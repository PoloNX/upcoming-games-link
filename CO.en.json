The Bats bring with them a talent for metallurgy and a disdain for weakness, growing more resolute when their compatriots falter. \n\nMeanwhile, as smugglers grow bolder, the harsh Rocky Ravines become an option for settlers \u2013 barren lands rich in ore and minerals. Viceroys building settlements among the scraggly rocks will find themselves reliant on black market traders while mining the basalt columns that grow here in place of trees. \n\nThose seeking more verdant fields will find suitable sites among the Bamboo Flats instead. Though lush with life, the heavy rainfall erodes the loose soil, and settlers must work carefully to appease a peculiar species local to the ecosystem if they want any chance at success: the Fluffbeak. If kept happy, this beast is able to produce fertilizer, giving the local Viceroy an opportunity to plan exactly where to enrich the soil and secure the future of their settlement.\n\nNightwatchers includes:\n- Bats have little patience for weakness, having grown hardy and austere in their isolated underground halls. Fiercely devoted and stern, they bring their expertise with metals and a willingness to make sacrifices for the greater good. Once the Bats\u2019 starting ability is unlocked, you will be granted access to the Manorial Court blueprint \u2013 use it to expel a member of a chosen species, leveraging this harsh punishment to motivate all who remain to work harder in the name of the Scorched Queen.\n- The Rocky Ravine biome presents an unforgiving landscape where even the trees are made of stone, and the Black Market will be a key partner in your success \u2013 with fluctuating prices and a notable lack of wood, you\u2019ll need to leverage your plentiful stone and amber to acquire the resources needed to keep your settlement growing. But be warned \u2013 these criminals will quickly turn from merchants to miscreants, and while they present an excellent opportunity, they also expect debts to be paid in a timely manner. \n- Settle the Bamboo Flats biome with the help of an unlikely ally \u2013 though the constant rain has left these regions devoid of fertile soil, the giant Fluffbeak, if kept happy,  is able to produce copious amounts of fertilizer to help create areas of fertile soil and establish a flourishing settlement.\n- 3 new World Map Modifiers will bring harsher lands to conquer. From the Riverlands and their minimal space to places of great significance for the ancients, still watched by silent guardians that limit the number of Cornerstones that can be used.\n- 3 new World Events introduce an increasingly powerful criminal organization, explosive alchemical experiments that threaten your carefully laid-out plans, and a tree-eating beast that inadvertently opens glades and unleashes the secrets hidden within them, whether you\u2019re ready or not.\n- 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 16 new Deeds, and 6 new Decorations have been added alongside new rewards to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Bats as a playable species, you must reach level 11.\n\nPunish the meek and push forth into harsher lands in service of the Scorched Queen \u2013 with the Bats by your side, there is little room for the weak-willed.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Against the Storm - Nightwatchers","nsuId":70050000061908,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Alcohol Reference","Fantasy Violence","Language","Mild Blood","Use of Tobacco","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251204,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4a8e6a5f9ae70c810c16320832a0b0c34a756c380a346c8ebb10d20b189b3ec0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/41733e34d8c37ce0f70004eb02623452c830e32980404237225245176f3f1cd7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/696dfd68644243065e7838c9288a018ec76399458147b0b0235773fb5d24b1a3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/563c33ddb4697963ed21c17f9f92bc3ecf8ea91dd4e1edbdac4efd46708a12b2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/21a22793e82222f2b06638047cbbc66de9bdd659cb884db1f478a5e1793c7d4b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4680e84e28b9e119873419958c15e84d150095864297f842f6236642db913c06.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70050000062489":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6bc40d5d63f7139f26f29c3d0d9b82dbcbae85e2bebcd2995d39c991e665c802.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enhance your experience on Viewros with this upgrade pack.
