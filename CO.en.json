Every room hides clues to a forgotten story, every sound pushes you deeper into fear, and the only way forward is to uncover the legacy left behind.\n\nWhat begins as an investigation becomes a struggle for survival when you encounter the two forces that haunt the clinic - the ghost of Liza, trapped between innocence and suffering, and Subject Zero, the final experiment born from a desperate father\u2019s mind. With no weapons and nowhere safe, you must solve puzzles, follow the traces of the past, and escape a place where reality breaks under the weight of trauma. Your path to freedom is built from fragments of truth - and the clinic never forgets.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n-First-person psychological horror experience in a decaying clinic\n- Story-driven exploration with hidden rooms and secret passages\n- Two hostile entities that shape the atmosphere and progression\n- Environmental puzzles that reveal the past piece by piece\n- Suspenseful survival moments where silence is your only protection\n- A haunting narrative about loss, obsession, and forbidden science\n\nThe truth isn\u2019t just buried - it\u2019s alive. Face the Legacy of Shnaus and escape before the past closes in.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/20c7c1ef4904a9c51dbd133bcbbd8f321f68c7fa800151df8a3ea637e5189a54.jpg","id":"01003A7025B66000","intro":"Step inside.

Do you rescue your comrades or listen to the alien voice in your head and harvest them for upgrades?\n\nIf you can persevere and defeat the Star Spores, perhaps you can save everyone\u2026including yourself.\"\nGAME FEATURES\nMASTER THE CHAINSTAFF\nHurl it as a spear and slice aliens in half. Throw it to the ground as a shield to stop incoming attacks. Grapple and swing on just about anything. The transforming ChainStaff does all this and more, and all with one button, it\u2019s all up to you.\nYOU DIED\nPounded to mush, stabbed through the heart, sheared in two. Prepare to meet your doom in a myriad of disgusting ways. All deaths are avoidable, but some dangers may require special strategies.\nFEROCIOUS FOES\nThe creatures of Earth have been mutated by aliens: you\u2019ll come across dozens of unusual creatures, and once you get past those, you\u2019ll have to fight against screen-filling monstrosities.\nGROTESQUE UPGRADES\nStranded soldiers dot the landscape of ChainStaff. You must choose whether to rescue them or devour their organs; each option has unique benefits and will lead to different endings.\n10 WILD LEVELS\n\"Mist trails through rocky crags.\nWind blows over icy, moon-lit hills.\nWater streams down mossy cliffs.\nFully hand-drawn art immerses you in a living world inspired by album covers of the 70s and 80s.\"\nKILLER SOUNDTRACK\n\"Scorching riffs and peals of thunder. Pumping beats drive you ever forward.\nRock out to the classic metal soundtrack by the award-winning composer Deon van Heerden of Broforce and Warhammer 40k: Shootas Blood & Teef soundtrack fame. There\u2019s some lighter interludes with 70s synth, catchy melodies, and even some cowbell. Now it\u2019s back to the heavy tracks, where it\u2019s time to bang your head while smashing skulls.\n\nAll depictions of violence are 2 dimensional and heavily stylized. As part of your quest to cleanse Earth of the Star Spore menace, you'll use all the weapons at your disposal to defeat your foes, many of whom will die bloody deaths. Additionally, you may harvest resources from your fellow soldiers in order to increase the power of the alien keeping you alive, and this process is messy.
