Experiment with a variety of armaments and create your own style of combat.\n\n- Enjoy the latest metroidvania from Team Ladybug, the team behind such acclaimed titles as \"Touhou Luna Nights\" and \"Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth\".\n- Explore a map far larger than past Team Ladybug projects, filled with side quests that both deepen your connection to and expand upon the world of \"Blade Chimera\".\n\nThe Story :\nIt all began with the sudden appearance of a ghastly demonic horde.

Get the right dishes to the right customers and customize your kitchen and dining hall with the help of local artisans.\n\nMaster the Flavors of Fighting\nKnock out monsters and rivals with Salty, Sour, Sweet, Bitter, Umami, Frosty and Toasty powers that unleash flame, poison, chain lightning, and other fantastic effects. You can also fight with unique utensils and gourmet gear, like Spatula, Smackerel, Swordfish, and the newly added Konpeito Fist weapons! \n\nTake Quests to Go\nFrom Naicha the Bubble Tea seller to Alder the big friendly carpenter, Paell is full of sweet and spicy townsfolk to befriend. While you\u2019re dungeon diving, be on the lookout for items the townsfolk need. You\u2019ll be rewarded with gold, new items, and even more recipes to take your cooking and adventuring to new heights.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/09d025a43d0b381ce37d2fb730d1700ea2a1035d5fe3fdeaab365529662a9d6a.jpg","id":"010087E01FCD6000","intro":"The super cute and tasty roguelite-flavored dungeon crawler and restaurant sim makes its way to Nintendo Switch\u2122!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Cuisineer","nsuId":70010000083966,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Marvelous (XSEED)","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Alcohol Reference","Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250128,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/81576e6ef7d4d8518afde51c85519a22201800c10c9a22b422ce968807fb0653.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c8ff9e6b82b6a31d7284b80a52f39398a3ba28fa9058b450b7e6961439bf4cde.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7ae617b48037e6c796a6fa7a03194afd0566f1ad2d21ed0753f1917104319e27.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5f671bba963380164e8050ca6cfe0d171419584379edb8bdd7964b8509ddb0f0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1ef310d6e04a647625bf234548ef074696a742a5d3d531bd00e635e0afe2a4d9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/21d30605477b7f9dda09bef036f41479fe3dc1e6333859324d9dc3d3a9eb33fc.jpg"],"size":1827667968,"version":null},"70050000050273":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b58f82b87f403bd77f5c04e57f22d07a215b4b62f83eb46479980cee604b7386.jpg","category":null,"description":"Gear up in the ancient armours of old with the 'Augur of the Draugr' pack for Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070243,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mild Language","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70050000052466":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/786f0b737d8892c7c2af512af6ca42dcde85fc2928287d590ce5347078fb8f1f.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enjoy a new original scenario, including new quests and stories.\n\nNote:\n- This product is scheduled to become available by the end of January 2025.\n\n- Content can be accessed after reaching a designated point in the game.\n- The details and release dates of any content may be changed with no notice.

Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
