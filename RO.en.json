Play as Vesper, a member of the Stalkers, and traverse the ruined world of Medhram on a mission to save humanity from a deadly cycle of annihilation. Endure nightmarish overworlds, slash through horrific dungeons, face brutal bosses, and wield an arsenal of powers in a relentless struggle against the Night itself.\n\nIn the 9th Age, humanity is trapped in a vicious cycle on the verge of extinction. The day is ruled by humans, while the Night brings annihilation by horrid creatures. A group of humans called \u2018The Stalkers\u2019 once wielded power to hold back the horrors, but their sacrifice only delayed the inevitable.\n\nNow, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of a traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.\n\nENGAGE IN FAST-PACED DYNAMIC COMBAT\nDash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers. You can switch between melee and ranged attack in quick succession: slashing enemies with your sword and then dashing away to use your ranged weapons, avoiding enemy attacks.\n\nFACE INTENSE CHALLENGING BOSSES\nEndure the ultimate challenge as you fight the ancient horrors of the Night that have been annihilating humanity over and over in intense boss battles. Learn their weak points, attack patterns and survive through the different combat phases as the battle gets more challenging and extreme.\n\nUPGRADE AND CUSTOMIZE VESPER'S BUILD\nCreate your own build that will adapt not only to your preferred gameplay but also to particular bosses. Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.\n\nDISCOVER THE DARK WORLD OF MEDHRAM\nExplore Medhram in a combination of action-adventure and dark fantasy lore. Survive huge dungeons full of traps, enemies, puzzles and challenges. Discover all kinds of locations, from ancient cathedrals and libraries of knowledge to lost kingdoms and devastated floating cities.\n\nCOMPLETE 'HUNTS' AS A MEMBER OF THE STALKERS\nAccept a hunt at \u2018Crow\u2019s Nest\u2019 and track down the dark beast, find where it hides and hunt the most powerful creatures of the Night. After every completed hunt you will get rewards that will increase your health and dark energy bar.\n\nFIND SECONDARY CHARACTERS AND DISCOVER THEIR STORIES\nMeet new characters and discover their tragic past and stories in a world that is on the brink of the abyss.\n\nPLAY TO ADAPTED AND IMMERSIVE MUSIC\nImmersive and adapted music to every moment, boss and location, with the collaboration of Hiroki Kikuta.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/95da337bfac39896c4ec2eb56299e66cdbff7a4043405f58870c01ab23b7c55b.jpg","id":"01009440164AE000","intro":"Darkness never rests, and neither will you.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","ru","ko","zh","zh","pl"],"name":"Hunt the Night","nsuId":70010000066614,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"DANGEN Entertainment","rating":16,"ratingContent":["Strong Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260226,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cedc3d8a6d5343d26ae38e9935165fcce27f2ec5da279f1908bb678cc9c5a9f8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f5d222c31c83bac3ba9b4edb855a5a3557ee49c1ce03dd77c6f4fc22dd82c3f8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/56f7b8954af1ef4da5d9da4b32448f2cd4eca5e8414725a129f6761a185b311b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/98e9176533990f9a8b37d487ae5789fad473dc3fd9a51c3eb62fa41cf4ff382b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cbbaa229408f124668c6d7a9459bc5f7c40781bd1a5f903ff1922221df88fdd5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/55e277a43d222fc606ef355a7a8f2f47cd696317e164c55afb36a4870c472bbe.jpg"],"size":1851785216,"version":null},"70010000099536":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5ddd651cb68c5cd97371b950bdcf895271aa80c66f0b351519c2aeff8544bb76.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","RPG","Other"],"description":"A ruinous cataclysm unleashed by a tormented god descended the world of Talamhel into perpetual night. The hourglass of time was shattered and its essence poured across the land, creating an endless sea of sand. The once-flourishing world of Talamhel became a putrid lesion of its former glory and those who called it home are now husks of corruption--violent, undying, unyielding soldiers of death. \n\nBut Talamhel is not lost--not yet. \n\nFor generations, the righteous few have endured. You are one of those few. On the eve of your induction into the Order of Remnant Knights, the last protectors of man, Talamhel is once-again wracked by calamity. The corruptive nature of the Night Plague has mutated, and the realm of man needs the Remnant Knights more than ever. \n\nTrack down the emergent evil and destroy it. Protect the realm of man. \n\nFrom the helm of your nimble grainwake, carve across the perilous sandseas to confront the source of this newfound terror, but don\u2019t expect a guiding light or a red X on a map. You\u2019ll chart your own course forward--behold the open seas, and choose the heading you best see fit. \n\nBut familiarity is a far-flung concept aboard the grainwake--the shifting sands are always changing, revealing secrets, dangers, and paths unseen. Things are not as they seem\u2026 \n-Talamhel is an open world, free to explore and discover as you please. \n-Every island is a unique, colorful encounter of combat, lore, and plunder. \n-With tiered levels of difficulty, locations offer challenges that will reward those who overcome. \n-With a trusted (undead) companion rested in the crow\u2019s nest, you\u2019ll never sail the seas alone. \n\nThe corruption that plagues Talamhel has created a horde comprised of both man and other Talamhelic natives: The venerable Ferrum and the insectoid, hive-minded Hashara. Once warring nations have become an abominable army of undying malice. \n\nFrom doomsday cultists to fallen kings, the foes that guard the answers you seek are determined to see your end. Prepare for an unrelenting, unforgiving combat experience not to be taken lightly. Swing true, dear knight, swing true. \n\nWith hundreds of weapon components to be reclaimed from the crumbled remains of civilization, there are thousands of unique weapons to be forged. Find the hilt that fits just right. \n-Cleave through the corruption with 7 distinct fighting styles. \n-Bolster yourself with dozens of armor sets, each with their own unique defenses. \n-Combine and modify your devastation with magical augments, creating a personalized build.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7c92b955255503ea6e4e6501094e53f561993024800ab2d4aa3f8d7981f23e55.jpg","id":"0100B1A023F18000","intro":"Sail across the sandseas to return life to a dying world in an unforgettable experience that is equal parts engaging story and unrelenting, souls-like combat.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","ru","ko","zh"],"name":"Sands of Aura","nsuId":70010000099536,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"indie.io","rating":16,"ratingContent":["Strong Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260226,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/09552b3a2ea3bc54e10f2d9ad7ddf6525475febeb99f76ca098d3173d2b6305b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/65ba16bb84802c9b53a7d6e2b58ddaa125e561efe503235f29f217286a3ac4ea.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76251fea123da58e8c2ddc93bcea47a0c948b5cf78bccfd32528d3eae503b3a0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3687d95f9821600b385c3dd2e047d1a9ea95b02a1bc3cfcba342794e81bf8770.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0fe6cbf5a163f3d0fa534a2c9a62343594ee196565826bd6fc75b1f198ac4c1b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/faa3029ac6b51efd251ea58dc74381afcab44c49da2c4122192b222346a981e1.jpg"],"size":6815744000,"version":null},"70010000100614":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f73eb6d7f545239e170986c0e21c2df2219f0cda913313f9b753ff90054b1adb.jpg","category":["Adventure","Simulation"],"description":"\u201cUm, please be the new manager of the cafe!\u201d\n Fuwa Fuwa Cafe\u2014a maid cafe tucked away in a quiet part of Nipponbashi, and where a wonderful encounter is about to take place...\n You, the protagonist, quit your job at an extremely toxic workplace and find yourself at a run-down maid cafe, where a cute maid named Shiro works.\n At first, you only agree to become the new manager because it conveniently met all your urgent needs, but soon the colorful maids Miyu, Favna, and Honoka join in.

It's a huge open world, full of hidden secrets, treasures, and creatures. Explore the woods, fight monsters, talk to ostensibly shady characters, walk away from those characters mid-conversation (if you want to), and get so lost you fall out of the world entirely (and maybe even into another). You never know what the forest might be hiding, and not all trails are paved. Labyrinths and dungeons are tucked away in the most concealed nooks. There are no waypoints in Afterplace. You'll have to forge your own path.\n\nAfterplace strives to bring an experience that feels both small and immense at the same time. The game has simple, fluid controls, allowing you to focus on exploration and discovery. Characters are happy to chat - or you can run right past them! You get to choose what story to explore, if any at all (we are not responsible for the consequences of ignoring the story, whatever they may be).\n\nFEATURES\n\n-About 10 hours of unique gameplay (and much more if you lose your way)\n-No overworld map\n-An open world that lets you explore any path in any order\n-Tons of friends, enemies, and at least one frenemy\n-The ability to upgrade weapons, purchase armor, and ingest hazardous chemicals to increase your power\n-Okay maybe there is an overworld map\n-Multiple endings, decided by choices you probably don't even know you're making\n-Like 25 unique enemies?

During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!\n\nBUILD ON A MOUNTAIN\nEach mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.\n\nDEAL WITH AVALANCHES\nOne of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can\u2019t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it\u2019s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!\n\nCRAFT A TRANSPORT NETWORK\nSo, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town\u2019s population, always look for opportunities to optimise your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.\n\nRAISE A SUMMIT TEMPLE\nIf you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavour you\u2019ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.\n\nFinal note: the game is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource management and surviving despite the inhospitable environment.

One of these brave warriors was Nobushige Sanada, the second son of the Sanada family who was cast away to Mt. Kudo on house arrest after the Battle of Sekigahara.\n\nAlongside Nobushige on his escape from Mt. Kudo are the Sanada Ten Braves, ten ninjas who serve him even after their exile.

Do you rescue your comrades or listen to the alien voice in your head and harvest them for upgrades?\n\nIf you can persevere and defeat the Star Spores, perhaps you can save everyone\u2026including yourself.\"\nGAME FEATURES\nMASTER THE CHAINSTAFF\nHurl it as a spear and slice aliens in half. Throw it to the ground as a shield to stop incoming attacks. Grapple and swing on just about anything. The transforming ChainStaff does all this and more, and all with one button, it\u2019s all up to you.\nYOU DIED\nPounded to mush, stabbed through the heart, sheared in two. Prepare to meet your doom in a myriad of disgusting ways. All deaths are avoidable, but some dangers may require special strategies.\nFEROCIOUS FOES\nThe creatures of Earth have been mutated by aliens: you\u2019ll come across dozens of unusual creatures, and once you get past those, you\u2019ll have to fight against screen-filling monstrosities.\nGROTESQUE UPGRADES\nStranded soldiers dot the landscape of ChainStaff. You must choose whether to rescue them or devour their organs; each option has unique benefits and will lead to different endings.\n10 WILD LEVELS\n\"Mist trails through rocky crags.\nWind blows over icy, moon-lit hills.\nWater streams down mossy cliffs.\nFully hand-drawn art immerses you in a living world inspired by album covers of the 70s and 80s.\"\nKILLER SOUNDTRACK\n\"Scorching riffs and peals of thunder. Pumping beats drive you ever forward.\nRock out to the classic metal soundtrack by the award-winning composer Deon van Heerden of Broforce and Warhammer 40k: Shootas Blood & Teef soundtrack fame. There\u2019s some lighter interludes with 70s synth, catchy melodies, and even some cowbell. Now it\u2019s back to the heavy tracks, where it\u2019s time to bang your head while smashing skulls.\n\nAll depictions of violence are 2 dimensional and heavily stylized. As part of your quest to cleanse Earth of the Star Spore menace, you'll use all the weapons at your disposal to defeat your foes, many of whom will die bloody deaths. Additionally, you may harvest resources from your fellow soldiers in order to increase the power of the alien keeping you alive, and this process is messy.

Read the enemy\u2019s telegraphed attacks and choose your path: use your \"Jinma Cards\" to strike, or hold them in hand to bolster your defenses? Every successful battle grants you a choice of a new Jinma card to add to your current deck, opening up endless strategic deck building possibilities. Experience a battle system that is streamlined, fast-paced, and deceptively deep.\n\nA Gripping Story Where Myth and Reality Collide\nA multi-perspective saga of four \"Tsukuyomi\" agents, each walking a divergent path. Switch between characters to experience their conflicting convictions and personal battles. Only by reaching the summit will you uncover the colossal truth hidden within THE HASHIRA.\n\nForge a Unique Arsenal Through Every Decision\nYour decisions during exploration directly shape the properties of special \"Creation Cards\" that are earned and added to your deck over the course of your exploration. Even if you fall in battle, these cards are not lost to the void. Instead, you retain the chance to reclaim them in future runs. Through repeated cycles of death and rebirth, your deck expands and evolves, allowing you to craft a build that is uniquely yours.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/44fd5d146bc354b58353f740e6060256e2ea7c8bce08202d507bd153d292bca7.jpg","id":"0100D21024DF6000","intro":"Ancient myths awaken in a modern-day Babel.
