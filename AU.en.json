Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!\n\nWith a highly customisable class system, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging loot that truly changes the way you play: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.\n\nKeeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat. After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each procedurally generated adventure. If you\u2019re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with 6 different difficulty levels \u2013 or pick Hardcore Mode with permadeath, where every battle can be the last!\n\nAlso features Roguelike Mode, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!\n\nCarve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield.

A lone island, sitting in the middle of an endless ocean, and the site of a magical phenomenon known only as the Rift. It was once a source of limitless power for humanity, through magical creatures called the Ateyan. Capable of incredible and wonderful feats of magic, they lived alongside humanity for centuries - until something destroyed this harmony. The Ateyan disappeared, becoming motes of light on an almost deserted island. Human civilizations crumbled, its formerly great cities and industry reclaimed by nature. Generations passed in the shadow of ancient splendor. Then, something happened: The Rift began consuming the island, threatening the survival of humanity's remnants.\n\nMonster Tribe puts you in the shoes of humanity's last hope, a sage born with a natural connection to the Ateyan, capable of calling them forth from the void between the real world and the Rift. Set out across Akama, collect an army of Ateyan, train them, and unearth long-forgotten secrets. Why did Akama fall? What caused the Ateyan to disappear into the void? Can the rift be stopped?\n\nCan a single human make a difference?\n\nIsland of Akama\n\nThe vast island has a long and terrible history. The disappearance of the Ateyan destroyed human civilization, leaving behind precious few survivors - and an endless array of secrets waiting to be discovered.\nAwaken the Ateyan! Living within the void between the real and the Rift, they can be seen as motes of light floating across the island. Use the hero's connection to awaken them, and harness their power once more!\n\nExplore ancient ruins and foreboding wilds. Gather resources to upgrade your equipment and help the awakened Ateyan grow and train. You'll need it.\n\nUncover lost lore and terrible secrets of those who came before. Can you survive long enough to reveal the frightening truth of what happened on Akama?\n\nThe Rift\n\nNature has reclaimed Akama's great cities from humanity, and it will not relinquish its conquests easily. Neither will the Ateyan simply surrender after centuries of peace from mankind.\n\nCommand teams of monsters in turn-based combat: Battles take place on a grid, where teams of up to four Ateyan square off against one another. Think, strategize, and prevail!\n\nDevelop a mighty team capable of facing the Rift. As your Ateyan gather experience, manage their development using a flexible RPG-style character system.\n\nOvercome the ultimate challenges, entering the ancient Towers that dot the landscape of Akama. Face vicious monsters and solve complex puzzles to unlock the island's mysteries!\n\n- Vast island to explore, where nature reclaimed the ruins of a once-mighty civilization.\n- Complex tactical battles between teams of monsters, using a turn-based system - brains over brawn!\n- 72 Ateyan to gather, command, and develop into mighty fighters, using a flexible RPG system.\n- Special mutation forms, unlocked by harnessing the island's special resources and salvaging the ruins of a lost civilization.\n- Thought-provoking story, full of secrets to discover and questions to answer in mankind's desperate last attempt at survival.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7d546ed03a0098228c00e85dbaa73651f0ced1bd1b623806bc9e929d0081768b.jpg","id":"010081301D280000","intro":"Collect and train an army of Ateyan!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Monster Tribe","nsuId":70010000073222,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Freedom Games","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild Themes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240315,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e04f5a088b5937d0e500c3fb6904c81cd86fe887ebe4995d92349255351dfeb4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0c070aea794e0c07c2fb0566c688af989f4656ebe5456c076946b8583fe9086d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c0d81e061f134a471e81ea611f979fd06f8a270cfd37268e0299a7ce1285c863.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4030e83c84e1ca848a9cfe1ea97a7cf0e56ee7cbde852f145997512ab198e9f1.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/62c8b222ab6f2ef31c87887ff9ccccfa2f8118700c15bebdcd73db13f4417f1f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/59107e65bd6bb7e8ca76a510eaf58ec315074263cee0bd90ccbd69a416ab4de4.jpg"],"size":380633088,"version":null},"70010000076066":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/15799f000e441d1074613ba758376ae89ab8f0f9fc571e313735883ab9fdee7b.jpg","category":["Adventure","Action","Puzzle"],"description":"Set in a creepy and melancholic world, GYLT is an eerie story mixing fantasy and reality in a surrealist place where your nightmares become reality.
