A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud.

You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.\n\nPUSH YOUR LUCK\nEach character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success.\n\nNAVIGATE THE BELT\nChart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Starward Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.\n\nDO THE JOB, GET PAID\nContracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FUTURE\nPlayer choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices.

CASEY JONES, OFF THE BENCH!\n\nThe Turtles can use all the help they can get as they go up against Shredder and try to get their Father back. Thankfully, their friend and fellow vigilante Casey Jones is always ready to pick up his hockey stick and do some damage. What's more, he happens to know a shortcut to the rooftops of NYC! Strangely, their path takes them straight through the Junkyards and Punk Frog turf. Could this have anything to do with Casey\u2019s missing ride?\nThey are no match for Casey, though\u2013 what he lacks in finesse he more than makes up for in raw power. His Slapshot becomes the first ranged attack in the game, taking down punks left and right.\n\nWELCOME TO THE JUNKYARD\n\nAfter defeating Karai, you have your choice to enter the Streets, or try your luck in the Junkyard. The Junkyard brings an all new narrative starring Casey, the Punk Frogs, their mechanic, Gigi, and a surprise Punk Frog encore.\nWhile a junkyard wouldn\u2019t normally feel homey, the Punk Frogs have settled in and made it their own. The warmth from the blazing barrel fires, the completely non-toxic pools of water, the artistry of Frog graffiti peppering the landscape. What could be better?\nMake sure you visit Gigi\u2019s Chop Shop, the Crane Vista, and complete your stay with a lively bop in the Battlebot Arena.\n\nNEW ENEMIES AND CHALLENGING BOSSES\n\nThe Punk Frogs continue to test your patience while you make your way through the Junkyard. The crafty Attila has cobbled together repurposed versions of Stockgen robots to wreak all kinds of havoc. Gigi, the vivacious toad mechanic and a threat the Turtles and their friends have never before faced, wields her sawblade with ferocity to make for a challenging mid-run foe.

It's a sleek, streamlined experience with just two buttons\u2014fire and bomb\u2014making it easy to pick up but hard to master. What sets the game apart is the tilt mechanic: as you turn, your shots tilt slightly left or right, allowing for strategic, angled attacks. You also have a small, satellite-like option unit that shoots independently. However, charging it requires you to release the fire button for a while, creating a tactical ebb and flow rarely seen in this all-out shoot 'em up genre.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\nThere\u2019s a big difference between an arcade game and one you play at home, and Under Defeat has gotten several new additions since its arcade debut in 2005. The New Order Mode adapts the game to a modern 16:9 format, and the game has received both sharper textures and four selectable soundtracks. This includes a brand new one from original composer Shinji Hosoe, known for his work on Ridge Racer, Tekken, Street Fighter EX, SuperSweep among many others. Of course, for an authentic experience, you can still play Under Defeat in its original arcade format. How you enjoy this bombastic action fest is entirely up to you! \n\nA BLAST FROM THE PAST\nUnder Defeat is a true classic. The game first appeared in arcades, developed by G.rev and released in Japan almost two decades ago. Over the years, it has made its way to several platforms. Most notably, it was released on the Dreamcast in 2006\u2014long after official support for the console had ended. This 2024 edition is the ultimate version of the game, containing all previous content, meticulously ported by genre veterans. \n\nNEVERENDING WAR\nUnder Defeat doesn\u2019t throw you into an incomprehensible sci-fi universe that make no sense. Instead, it offers a (mostly) realistic depiction of a futuristic past. Specifically, you play as a helicopter pilot in a drawn-out war between the German-speaking Empire and the English-speaking Union, a conflict that has raged for over a decade. Both sides are exhausted, with heavy losses on each side, yet peace remains elusive. Will this destructive conflict ever end? You'll have to play to find out!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d615b3e1f60176e1b43594db713ca8b3bc3611ed70fd06564002963d5ecfa2f9.jpg","id":"0100E1301FEDC000","intro":"FIGHT FOR PEACE IN THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF AN ALL-TIME CLASSIC!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it"],"name":"Under Defeat","nsuId":70010000084450,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Clear River Games","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250207,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80dab6c84efc51e64d3a02bd7e8cca426fcf3f47ce389a122972c59455c90ce9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/03ae49541d214fde07ee4862cda34aa2fc9680512e126a7a80aea90c06824d6b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/600a499f513c46859446b66c65ae496f8928c2db94efe994e3f12c265d2701c3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cafacf52f1064941c40d522e4fdf576a69c481d020e625365f8933959f085810.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f88370f0981c24397f3b7e63b0ab692f19383f9996d0b89f965bddb2f1c3726d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9ff0f07f4fe0d481a38311b80aa5a9a4eaf7723d911fcf9f61c5a6ead3190106.jpg"],"size":347078656,"version":null},"70010000087088":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9495dee1cdfedc00bd983962e59344aa732cb09de16ce099bd58b54505c396c3.jpg","category":["Adventure","Simulation","RPG","Puzzle"],"description":"Solve mysteries, find the lost, help people in trouble, track down criminals and save lives as Biscuit, the one-and-only doggo detective!

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.

This made every playthrough (attempt) feel different and unique.\n\nIn 2024 the highly challenging underwater shoot \u2018em up from the game development legends at Rainbow Arts is finally returning.\nININ and Ziggurat have collaborated to bring you a faithful remake completely rebuilt from the ground up and greatly improved.\n\nRedrawn:\nThe impressive sprite work of yesteryear has not only been remade into even more impressive modern high-resolution sprites but also greatly expanded upon with particle and lighting effects. 8 varied stages, the enemies, the bosses, the ships, the projectiles\u2014everything shines in a brand-new light!\n\nRemixed:\nApart from the visual journey of each playthrough, you\u2019ll embark on a musical one as well: epic synth soundscapes that drive you forward by the magnificent Chris H\u00fclsbeck. In addition to him remastering his original works, we have created six entirely new tracks as well.\n\nRemembered:\nAnd it's not just Chris H\u00fclsbeck who has returned for this remake: Ogan Kandemiroglu, the brother and co-artist of Celal Kandemiroglu who created the original iconic key art of X-Out, took on that task for the remake as a tribute.\n\nRe-equipped:\nThe shop system is back and thoroughly improved as well: new preconfigured load-outs allow you to jump straight into the action, added item descriptions help new cadets configure and build their fleet, and we've FINALLY marked the available slots for your weaponry.\n\nReinforced:\nShould you still feel overwhelmed by X-Out\u2019s challenge, then maybe it\u2019s time for a co-captain. Enlist a friend and face the terrors from the ocean deep together in the local 2-player co-op mode!\n\nReversed:\nIf you think you\u2019ve seen everything there is to the game already, then prepare to have your bearing changed and your gyro twisted in the Mirror Mode with its reverse-scrolling levels!\n\nRecapped:\n\u2022 Experience a fresh but faithful take on a real shoot-\u2019em-up classic!\n\u2022 Get dazzled by the new and beautiful sprite work mixed with shiny particle and lighting effects!\n\u2022 Take a journey through new and old synth soundscapes courtesy of composer legend Chris H\u00fclsbeck!\n\u2022 Choose one of three load-outs or build your own fleet in the improved shop system!\n\u2022 Grab a trusty ally and face the depths together in a 2-player couch co-op dive!\n\u2022 Get your world flipped, turned upside down in the Mirror Mode!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0d4de6fefb16837f6844cb403c5968c02c177d4d7aa3618982f18b15baa3ae50.jpg","id":"010048501F73E000","intro":"Relive the deep-sea classic!

It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","en","fr","de","pt"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086483,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000050725":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9fadf574c0130c86181477545df86b31f937a6a952f9cb87cd981d261f0c1cf4.jpg","category":null,"description":"*Content details and specifications are subject to change without prior notice.\n*Actual items may differ from the image shown.\n*The Umamusume: Pretty Derby \u2013 Party Dash Special Edition (Nintendo Switch\u2122) comes with Umamusume: Pretty Derby \u2013 Party Dash Team Bundle.
