    "description": "Inspired By the Classics, Made for the 21st Century\nChallenging platform parkour inspired by classic SEGA games of the 90s - The Jungle Book, Aladdin, Lion King \u2013 but with modern twists and ideas. Platform parkour through the remains of humanity. Outwit evolved wildlife and dangerous hybrid flora. Crack environmental puzzles that keep you guessing. And stay one step ahead of the wicked humans who are pursuing you in a twisted apocalyptic safari hunt.\n\nThe Story of a Hunted Cub\nAfter the Great Ecological Catastrophe, the ultrarich flee to Mars and leave the rest to perish. But among them a small child who developed immunity to the hostile planet remains. Decades pass and those on Mars venture back to Earth to do recon. When they spot a small human child, The Cub, they immediately try to capture it. This sets off a journey of escape, exploration and discovery through the urban ruins of humanity coupled with frantic cat and mouse chases.\n\nThis World Tells Tales\nExplore the ruins of humanity after the Great Ecological Catastrophe wipes out most of the civilization and leaves our remains to be reclaimed by an evolved mother nature. The story and clues of how and why humanity fell is strewn throughout the world. Crumbling brutalist tower blocks and abandoned genetics labs. Depleted chemical mines and overgrown battlefields. Each level has a story to tell.\n\nThe Perfect Tunes to Keep You Company\nAccompanying you on the journey is Radio Nostalgia From Mars, a custom soundtrack that\u2019ll crash land into your psyche. Sink into thought-provoking survivor stories from the few ultrarich living on Mars, while a smooth-voiced radio DJ keeps the show moving with a collection of chill apocalypse-wave tunes.\n\nIf Looks Could Bring Back Memories\nMeticulously drawn and stylized to look like the classic animated films of the late 90s - Atlantis, Tarzan, Road to El Dorado - while also taking a page from Samurai Jack\u2019s creator Genndy Tartakovsky critically acclaimed series, Primal.",

    "description": "I'm Joe Salinger, a dedicated paranormal investigator. I couldn't resist delving into the rumors circulating about ghostly sightings at Crimson Motel. \nThe unsettling news revolves around a chilling incident from several months ago: a maniacal psychopath brutally murdered two teenagers within the hotel's walls. \nIn response, the management abruptly shut down the motel, citing \"renovations\" as a cover.\nDuring the supposed renovations, a wave of eerie occurrences unfolded. Construction workers reported encountering apparitions, and some even suffered severe mental distress, compelling them to abandon their work at the site. \nThe enigma shrouding Crimson Motel piqued my curiosity; it's precisely the kind of mystery I thrive on.\nArmed with my investigative prowess, I am determined to gather concrete evidence within the hotel's haunting confines. Backed by my comprehensive computer setup in the van, I will meticulously process all the information I collect. My ultimate goal is to  capture undeniable proof of these spectral entities on video camera. \nIf I manage to record any ghostly apparitions, that would be my invaluable contribution to unraveling the secrets veiled within the Crimson Motel.",

    "description": "That's why in the atmosphere of an alien unfriendly planet, beneath the wide crown of the space garden \u00abAilanthus\u00bb, lives a race of artificial servants - Artifites.\n\nA young Artifite - explorer, Ein, is tormented by a vague longing. He doesn't know when the expedition began, and why it still can't reach its goal. One thing he knows for sure is that since they're stuck here for a while, he should find himself a girl. And he's got just the right one in mind.\n\nFrequent encounters in the wardroom, lunches together with the whole crew... the task seems a piece of cake. But there are three catches. First, the girl is as cold and unfriendly like cosmic ice. The second one, she's obsessed with exploring abandoned alien ruins, hidden beneath the planet's cloud cover. And the third one, the empty ruins have begun to respond to her.\n\nFeatures:\n- Studio Wirion's signature sci-fi story continues the tradition, established by the studio's previous project, the visual novel Athanasy; - Wirion's calling card - the niche \u00abbiopunk\u00bb genre;\n- a soundtrack specially made for the game by the duo Synthelligence, describing their genre of their music as \u00abmelodic sci-fi\u00bb;\n- professional artists and designers have created an incredible world, based on plant technology;\n- As expected of Wirion's distinctive style, this adult and daring story embraces the ideas, that are based on actual scientific research.",

In this genre mashup, you\u2019ll pick from 4 role-playing classes, each with their own unique stats and special skill, then set off on a quest to conquer evil by controlling a floating platform to deflect a magical orb into targets along the way.\n\nMove the platform left or right at the bottom of the screen and bounce the orb to keep it in play. Let the orb fly past you, and you\u2019ll lose a heart. But fret not, by destroying walls, gravestones, enemies and more with your orb, you\u2019ll cause power-ups and modifiers to drop towards your platform, some of which might heal you, some might shrink you, some might energize your orb for stronger attacks or have other effects!

It's every pirate for themselves in a back-stabbing, treasure-grabbing struggle, and only one may live...\n\nBullion: The Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle is a local multiplayer brawler for up to four players, featuring a cast of backstabbing bovine buccaneers and a unique blend of PvP and co-op gameplay.\n\nStranded on the Islands of Ser-Lloyn, the heathen gods have declared that only the one bringing the greatest offering of treasure shall live - so each pirate must grab as much loot as they can! Even death will not deny the gods their game; fallen pirates become ghosts and can return to life at their gravestones. However... should the entire crew fall at the same time then the game ends with no winner - so players must balance working together in order to keep at least one crewmember alive with doing whatever it takes in order to have the most treasure at the end of the battle! Unlock the secrets, voyage across the islands and battle titanic champions in an attempt to defy the gods and attempt to survive the Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle!",

    "description": "Scheduled for release by 30 April 2024\n\nIn this adventure, you'll be transferred from Uva Academy to its sister school, Blueberry Academy. Unlike Uva Academy, with its long and rich history, this school was only recently established and has a focus on teaching Pok\u00e9mon battles. What's unique about Blueberry Academy is that a large part of it is actually in the sea! Attend lessons, mingle with the local students and experience a new school life that's anything but ordinary.\n\n- You need to have completed the ending of Pok\u00e9mon Violet and Part 1: The Teal Mask to access the main story of Part 2: The Indigo Disk.",
