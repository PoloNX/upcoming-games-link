Together, players venture out into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat.  During combat, there is no set player turn order, so your strategy can adapt at a moment's notice to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to co-operatively find the best path to success. \n\nBetween missions, players return to Arden and help improve their home village. Unlock and upgrade different local vendors, build relationships with other Sunderfolk to earn rewards, and outfit characters with new Skills, Weapons, Trinkets, and more.\n\nAs heroes of Arden, protect the town and its Brightshard from the corruption of shadowstone and defeat threats from the surrounding Sunderlands. \n\nCouch Co-Op First\nThe best adventures are meant to be shared. Up to four players can play together in this new tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. \n\nStep into a New World \nScan a QR code on the display, download the free Sunderfolk phone app*, and transform your phone or tablet into a controller, hand of cards, rule book, inventory, and more. All friends and family can learn to play quickly, since all they need will be in-hand. \n\nSix Unique Heroes \nTraditional RPG classes have been reimagined in Sunderfolk.

Power up with Trinkets and Weapons to craft your character\u2019s build  quest-to-quest. \n\nTactical Combat Inspired by the Tabletop\nEach player takes their turn one at a time by choosing one of their Skill Cards to determine their character's actions. Enemies lurk around every corner, each with their own abilities and strategies, and they will challenge your party to change its approach from one encounter to the next.\n\nRebuild the Village of Arden \nThe village of Arden grew around the remnant of a magical substance known as brightstone, but unknown forces from lands outside have started to threaten this community's very existence. Between quests, return to Arden village to upgrade vendors, acquire new items and equipment, and befriend townsfolk for additional rewards. \n\nFour Players, One Game\nShare the experience of Sunderfolk with friends at no extra cost. Our rather unique mobile device as a controller mechanic lets one gamer share the adventure with three friends at no additional cost.

Her name was Addie Baker, and strangely enough, she is not the first to disappear in Looninville. For Lesley Jacobson, now a private phenomenon investigator, Addie Baker was her best friend and neighbor growing up. Twenty-eight-years later, Lesley is still haunted by the night Addie disappeared, as she was the only one to witness it, or was she?\n\nDeciding to combine her personal and professional life, Lesley returns to Looninville to close the mystery and move forward in life with her daughter. Lacking to find any concrete evidence or input from the skittish locals, Lesley returns to the one place that appears to be at the center of these strange occurrences, a cave. The uneasy problem with this, is that Lesley does not remember there ever being a cave at all.\n\nCave of Illusions is a psychological, atmospheric horror game that will have you questioning every step taken as the reality around you will begin to shift.

The mean magician Godron has stolen the book \u201eMathematica\u201c from the creator of Trillion, and has cast an evil spell over the city: a ban on mathematics. Godron wants to gain power over the whole land and transform the world according to his will.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","en","fr","de","pt"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086483,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000051000":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7a50fc3b553ddb4075e3d0fe0242107cbf76b60d47f27bb9c17221ba4483fc94.jpg","category":null,"description":null,"developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Ticket to Ride: Japan","nsuId":70050000051000,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Marmalade Game Studio","rating":0,"ratingContent":["Online Interactivity","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000053128":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1e1da244584fc4623f91ac451de009cbc583313dcfdb2dcbc10d0439f55ae786.jpg","category":null,"description":"\uff3c\uff3c Digital Bey Booster Vol.2\uff0f\uff0f\nIncludes 3 additional Beys that couldn't fit into the game!\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"BEYBLADE X XONE Digital Beybooster Vol.2","nsuId":70050000053128,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"FURYU Corporation","rating":0,"ratingContent":["In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000053129":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ec1827ca972cb0910d72694f6f2c80433c018d871f418a326a9b6a728fdd5cf3.jpg","category":null,"description":"Digital Beybooster Vol.3\nIncludes 3 additional Beys that couldn't fit into the game!\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\n\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"BEYBLADE X XONE Digital Beybooster Vol.3","nsuId":70050000053129,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"FURYU Corporation","rating":0,"ratingContent":["In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000056216":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/28d18169433ebe2612e76849a9cf2ebb2e976e4c0da55b33daeb2ee40865ec93.jpg","category":null,"description":"This DLC unlocks a brand new world for hexceed: Violaceum!
