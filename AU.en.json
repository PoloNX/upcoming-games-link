Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.\n\nDEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION \u2014 Don\u2019t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.\n\nFULLY SIMULATED CREATURES \u2014 Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.\n\nDYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM \u2014 Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.\n\nRICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING \u2014 Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.\n\nTACTICAL GAMEPLAY \u2014 Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.\n\nRPG ELEMENTS \u2014 Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.\n\nATMOSPHERIC ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK \u2014 Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.\n\nCaves of Qud has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.\n\nPlay the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes \u2014 the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.\n\nBuild your character out of:\n\n- Over 70 mutations \u2014 outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself\u2026\n\n- Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure) \u2014 night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons\u2026\n\n - 24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra\u2019yi, the Great Salt Desert\n\n - Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of 9 preset characters and start your adventure right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.\n\nPlay one of four modes:\n\nCLASSIC \u2014 Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.\n\nROLEPLAY \u2014 Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.\n\nWANDER \u2014 Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don\u2019t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.\n\nDAILY \u2014 One chance with a fixed character and world seed.

Even vampires need a shoulder to cry on when a neck to bite just won\u2019t do.\n\nSTORY\nVampire Therapist is a narrative adventure / therapy simulator in the vein (get it) of What We Do in the Shadows, Young Frankenstein, My Dinner with Andr\u00e9, and Horrible Histories where you play as a reformed bloodsucker helping other vampires find inner peace.\nThis isn't your typical visual novel \u2014 featuring a fangtastic cast (such as Matthew Mercer, Sarah Grayson, and Cyrus Nemati), Vampire Therapist teaches real therapy concepts with a story that explores what it means to live, die, live again, and maybe even how to feel alive. Because even vampires deserve to love themselves.\nStep into the boots of Sam, a reformed Wild West gunslinger turned vampire therapist. After centuries of bloodshed, Sam teams up with a 3000-year-old blood-sucking mentor in a moody German nightclub, to guide fellow vampires through the twists and turns of their immortal existence \u2014 offering them a chance at self-acceptance in a world that feels ever more alien.\n\n\nFEATURES\n1. Real Therapy Concepts: You\u2019ll learn and apply real cognitive behavioral therapy concepts vetted by licensed therapists. By challenging client statements that contain \u201ccognitive distortions\u201d, you\u2019ll help vampires see where their thoughts don\u2019t match reality.\n2. A Comedic Look Through History: Meet emotionally damaged vampires from ancient Greece, Renaissance Italy, Tudor England, and the Bronze Age.\n3.

You control a fox exploring levels filled with temaris and chests that range from 1 to 3 locks. Your goal is to plan the order and direction of every push while considering obstacles and placement.\n\nYou begin each stage by observing your options.

Just as \"II\" picked up right after the conclusion of the first game, this title begins the moment \"II\" ends. The story starts with a veteran warrior, who has survived countless adventures in the Dream World (Mugen-kai), finally returning to the nostalgic sights of their home world.\n\nThe game features a top-down perspective with symbol encounters (on-screen enemies). Players will form a party of up to four members to explore the world. While the protagonist is human, the potential allies are incredibly diverse\u2014ranging from familiar races like Elves and Dwarves to formidable beings like Dragons and Giants. In a unique mechanical twist, equipment is tied to Race rather than Class, making your party composition a vital strategic choice. Upon reaching Level 13, you can select specific abilities to undergo a Class Change, with certain paths unlocking even further advanced classes at higher levels.\n\nCombat utilizes an intuitive Auto-Battle system. Victory depends on the clever use of physical attacks and various magic spells. Defense is particularly effective against physical strikes, and mastering its use is the key to surviving tough encounters.\n\nAs a series highly regarded as a foundation of the Japanese RPG (JRPG) genre, it offers a grand narrative that is best experienced in its entirety. We invite you to take this opportunity to play through the series and witness the origins of the JRPG.\n \n\n *The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n *Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fdcd626f163f124cb8af1b283d8354c699d9876abe7ce8f12402d47dcd07fe75.jpg","id":"01002B60270C6000","intro":"The epic conclusion to the Mugen no Shinzou series.

Play as Vesper, a member of the Stalkers, and traverse the ruined world of Medhram on a mission to save humanity from a deadly cycle of annihilation. Endure nightmarish overworlds, slash through horrific dungeons, face brutal bosses, and wield an arsenal of powers in a relentless struggle against the Night itself.\n\nIn the 9th Age, humanity is trapped in a vicious cycle on the verge of extinction. The day is ruled by humans, while the Night brings annihilation by horrid creatures. A group of humans called \u2018The Stalkers\u2019 once wielded power to hold back the horrors, but their sacrifice only delayed the inevitable.\n\nNow, as the Night starts devouring every single glint of light, Vesper, a Stalker by right and daughter of a traitor, will travel a dying land trying to save the last embers of humanity. She hunts in a race against destiny, as the shadows lengthen both in the world and in her mind.\n\nENGAGE IN FAST-PACED DYNAMIC COMBAT\nDash through enemies while you unleash your combos, use your weapons or destroy them with your dark powers. You can switch between melee and ranged attack in quick succession: slashing enemies with your sword and then dashing away to use your ranged weapons, avoiding enemy attacks.\n\nFACE INTENSE CHALLENGING BOSSES\nEndure the ultimate challenge as you fight the ancient horrors of the Night that have been annihilating humanity over and over in intense boss battles. Learn their weak points, attack patterns and survive through the different combat phases as the battle gets more challenging and extreme.\n\nUPGRADE AND CUSTOMIZE VESPER'S BUILD\nCreate your own build that will adapt not only to your preferred gameplay but also to particular bosses. Customize the upgrades of your arsenal and use the equipment that best suits your gameplay: Critical Damage, Life Steal, Poison, Close Combat, Firepower and more. Collect Sanguine vials, Crow Feathers, Moonstones and Noctilium to increase your stats and get ready to face the Night.\n\nDISCOVER THE DARK WORLD OF MEDHRAM\nExplore Medhram in a combination of action-adventure and dark fantasy lore.

And as you spend time with them and meet the people of Electric Street, both you and the cafe will gradually liven up once more.\n \n Maid Cafe on Electric Street is a game set in Nipponbashi, the heart of Osaka\u2019s otaku culture. This is a story-focused adventure game where you enjoy daily life at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Make yourself a cup of coffee, relax, and immerse yourself in a heartwarming story.\n \n \n \u25a04 Cute, Memorable Heroines\nEnjoy voice-acted conversations with the four maids, all with distinct personalities.\n \u2665Shiro (VA: Ikumi Hasegawa)\n A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she\u2019s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she\u2019s always wanted to be.\n \n \u2665Miyu (VA: Ayasa Itou)\n A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite. Loves both eating and cooking, and apparently really enjoys serving her cooking to customers at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Is actually Shiro's friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.\n \n \u2665Favna (VA: Sayumi Suzushiro)\n A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar. She sometimes accidentally drops the edgy act when she's taken by surprise though, so maybe she's just got a serious case of chuunibyou...?\n \n \u2665Honoka (VA: Yui Ishikawa)\n A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine. Practically in charge of the shrine, she is reliable and very good at handling money! Is actually a doujin author...?\n \n \u25a0The Daily Life with the Four Maids of Fuwa Fuwa Cafe\n As the manager of Fuwa Fuwa, you\u2019ll live in Nipponbashi, Osaka and spend time with your favorite maid... or maids. Go shopping, watch a movie, go for karaoke, buy a present for a special someone... What you choose to do, and with whom, will affect the ending of the story.\n \n \u25a0Make Fuwa Fuwa Cafe Famous!\nAs the manager, it's your job to run the cafe. Improve the maids' work skills, optimize their roles, and drive up profits. The money you earn can be spent on shopping, food, capsule toys and more!\n \n \u25a0The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi\n Visit stores you can find in the real Nipponbashi, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among the many others we've collaborated with.\n Go shopping by yourself or go on dates with the maids and enjoy life in otaku heaven. But don't stay out too late; you still have a cafe to run!\n \n \u25a0Collectable Capsule Toys\n In this game, you can try to collect your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you're getting. Keep cranking those machines until you've collected them all!\n \n Other than capsule toys, there's more merch for you to collect, like video games, books, and figures.

The hourglass of time was shattered and its essence poured across the land, creating an endless sea of sand. The once-flourishing world of Talamhel became a putrid lesion of its former glory and those who called it home are now husks of corruption--violent, undying, unyielding soldiers of death. \n\nBut Talamhel is not lost--not yet. \n\nFor generations, the righteous few have endured. You are one of those few. On the eve of your induction into the Order of Remnant Knights, the last protectors of man, Talamhel is once-again wracked by calamity. The corruptive nature of the Night Plague has mutated, and the realm of man needs the Remnant Knights more than ever. \n\nTrack down the emergent evil and destroy it. Protect the realm of man. \n\nFrom the helm of your nimble grainwake, carve across the perilous sandseas to confront the source of this newfound terror, but don\u2019t expect a guiding light or a red X on a map. You\u2019ll chart your own course forward--behold the open seas, and choose the heading you best see fit. \n\nBut familiarity is a far-flung concept aboard the grainwake--the shifting sands are always changing, revealing secrets, dangers, and paths unseen. Things are not as they seem\u2026 \n-Talamhel is an open world, free to explore and discover as you please. \n-Every island is a unique, colorful encounter of combat, lore, and plunder. \n-With tiered levels of difficulty, locations offer challenges that will reward those who overcome. \n-With a trusted (undead) companion rested in the crow\u2019s nest, you\u2019ll never sail the seas alone. \n\nThe corruption that plagues Talamhel has created a horde comprised of both man and other Talamhelic natives: The venerable Ferrum and the insectoid, hive-minded Hashara. Once warring nations have become an abominable army of undying malice. \n\nFrom doomsday cultists to fallen kings, the foes that guard the answers you seek are determined to see your end. Prepare for an unrelenting, unforgiving combat experience not to be taken lightly. Swing true, dear knight, swing true. \n\nWith hundreds of weapon components to be reclaimed from the crumbled remains of civilization, there are thousands of unique weapons to be forged. Find the hilt that fits just right. \n-Cleave through the corruption with 7 distinct fighting styles. \n-Bolster yourself with dozens of armor sets, each with their own unique defenses. \n-Combine and modify your devastation with magical augments, creating a personalized build.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7c92b955255503ea6e4e6501094e53f561993024800ab2d4aa3f8d7981f23e55.jpg","id":"0100B1A023F18000","intro":"Sail across the sandseas to return life to a dying world in an unforgettable experience that is equal parts engaging story and unrelenting, souls-like combat.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","ru","ko","zh"],"name":"Sands of Aura","nsuId":70010000099536,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"indie.io","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260227,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/09552b3a2ea3bc54e10f2d9ad7ddf6525475febeb99f76ca098d3173d2b6305b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/65ba16bb84802c9b53a7d6e2b58ddaa125e561efe503235f29f217286a3ac4ea.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76251fea123da58e8c2ddc93bcea47a0c948b5cf78bccfd32528d3eae503b3a0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3687d95f9821600b385c3dd2e047d1a9ea95b02a1bc3cfcba342794e81bf8770.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0fe6cbf5a163f3d0fa534a2c9a62343594ee196565826bd6fc75b1f198ac4c1b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/faa3029ac6b51efd251ea58dc74381afcab44c49da2c4122192b222346a981e1.jpg"],"size":6815744000,"version":null},"70010000104061":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a1611c824583746fdcab4690be4387f863e24da8719a5377ec15783194a525ec.jpg","category":["Adventure"],"description":"Dive into the past.

It's a huge open world, full of hidden secrets, treasures, and creatures. Explore the woods, fight monsters, talk to ostensibly shady characters, walk away from those characters mid-conversation (if you want to), and get so lost you fall out of the world entirely (and maybe even into another). You never know what the forest might be hiding, and not all trails are paved. Labyrinths and dungeons are tucked away in the most concealed nooks. There are no waypoints in Afterplace. You'll have to forge your own path.\n\nAfterplace strives to bring an experience that feels both small and immense at the same time. The game has simple, fluid controls, allowing you to focus on exploration and discovery. Characters are happy to chat - or you can run right past them! You get to choose what story to explore, if any at all (we are not responsible for the consequences of ignoring the story, whatever they may be).\n\nFEATURES\n\n-About 10 hours of unique gameplay (and much more if you lose your way)\n-No overworld map\n-An open world that lets you explore any path in any order\n-Tons of friends, enemies, and at least one frenemy\n-The ability to upgrade weapons, purchase armor, and ingest hazardous chemicals to increase your power\n-Okay maybe there is an overworld map\n-Multiple endings, decided by choices you probably don't even know you're making\n-Like 25 unique enemies? That's a lot, right?\n-Wait, no, this overworld map is written on a napkin with crayon. That won't do. \n-Secret paths that will take you to completely normal and fun places\n-A cat that you can pet. With your sword. \n-The 25 unique monsters are really special though.

During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!\n\nBUILD ON A MOUNTAIN\nEach mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.\n\nDEAL WITH AVALANCHES\nOne of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can\u2019t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it\u2019s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!\n\nCRAFT A TRANSPORT NETWORK\nSo, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town\u2019s population, always look for opportunities to optimise your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.\n\nRAISE A SUMMIT TEMPLE\nIf you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavour you\u2019ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.\n\nFinal note: the game is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource management and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn\u2019t feature combat or any other military aspects.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/30ab956b4c53cbc233780eea0ae1880107d84a153663ca04b72b14f51190abe1.jpg","id":"010096602407A000","intro":"Build and expand your very own settlements in high mountains!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","pl"],"name":"Laysara: Summit Kingdom","nsuId":70010000099911,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Nejcraft","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Scary Scenes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260228,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/658fa78dfea58ee123e13daf5f7ab280281086f9a8013818940f58ef70e0f720.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/60ade298b5253990b6a39ffa92f139b3a73b0d9c26890fc1c486ad51877b475b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1be1f90bfe9b4288b438988a0c2b7d9475d4855b81b9ea325a5d325e7e56fffb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ee411e69b837ff216e1fe01738cdc52e85d611f81c5dfc4253d55ea147354c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/da9bb603a1ffcbafb55e8db0408ea8eab65282a3a3bf5e1e269608cdab2ffdd2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3aae056bbe73bc70eaf94d69fe268a64ea58bbefcbfcfdc36da9cb48a891d2c3.jpg"],"size":1396703232,"version":null},"70010000117220":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4c02d5ab611620ef2cb60c4d55255ecad83658a836a5e576180fb333de6531e2.jpg","category":["Arcade","Puzzle","Education","Other"],"description":"Escape into Jigsaw Realms: Oasis, a relaxing jigsaw puzzle adventure set in beautiful oasis landscapes.\n\nPiece together stunning scenes across 30 handcrafted levels, each one increasing in difficulty as your skills improve.

your new best friend has provided both the strength to fight back against the mutated horde, and control over a weapon that can tip the balance of the battle in humanity's favor: the\u00a0ChainStaff.\n\nAs you traverse the surreal landscape, you'll encounter your fellow soldiers, stranded in harsh environments. Do you rescue your comrades or listen to the alien voice in your head and harvest them for upgrades?\n\nIf you can persevere and defeat the Star Spores, perhaps you can save everyone\u2026including yourself.\"\nGAME FEATURES\nMASTER THE CHAINSTAFF\nHurl it as a spear and slice aliens in half. Throw it to the ground as a shield to stop incoming attacks. Grapple and swing on just about anything. The transforming ChainStaff does all this and more, and all with one button, it\u2019s all up to you.\nYOU DIED\nPounded to mush, stabbed through the heart, sheared in two. Prepare to meet your doom in a myriad of disgusting ways. All deaths are avoidable, but some dangers may require special strategies.\nFEROCIOUS FOES\nThe creatures of Earth have been mutated by aliens: you\u2019ll come across dozens of unusual creatures, and once you get past those, you\u2019ll have to fight against screen-filling monstrosities.\nGROTESQUE UPGRADES\nStranded soldiers dot the landscape of ChainStaff. You must choose whether to rescue them or devour their organs; each option has unique benefits and will lead to different endings.\n10 WILD LEVELS\n\"Mist trails through rocky crags.\nWind blows over icy, moon-lit hills.\nWater streams down mossy cliffs.\nFully hand-drawn art immerses you in a living world inspired by album covers of the 70s and 80s.\"\nKILLER SOUNDTRACK\n\"Scorching riffs and peals of thunder. Pumping beats drive you ever forward.\nRock out to the classic metal soundtrack by the award-winning composer Deon van Heerden of Broforce and Warhammer 40k: Shootas Blood & Teef soundtrack fame. There\u2019s some lighter interludes with 70s synth, catchy melodies, and even some cowbell. Now it\u2019s back to the heavy tracks, where it\u2019s time to bang your head while smashing skulls.\n\nAll depictions of violence are 2 dimensional and heavily stylized. As part of your quest to cleanse Earth of the Star Spore menace, you'll use all the weapons at your disposal to defeat your foes, many of whom will die bloody deaths. Additionally, you may harvest resources from your fellow soldiers in order to increase the power of the alien keeping you alive, and this process is messy.
