If they cannot find a way out of this Nowhere place, they\u2019ll be condemned to a fate worse than death. \n\nFACE YOUR CHILDHOOD FEARS TOGETHER\n\nYou play as Low and Alone, best friends ever since they found each other in this lonely nightmare. They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they\u2019ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWhether you\u2019re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you\u2019ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low\u2019s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone\u2019s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\n\nEMBARK ON AN IMMERSIVE AND DISTURBING ADVENTURE\n\nNo matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsettling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair. \n\nYou'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n\nSINK INTO THE SPIRAL\n\nDon\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere.

Sun King Azra took advantage of this panic, enslaving wizards through his Crimson Order and placing loyal princes to rule over the conquered realms.\nAs Azra\u2019s forces claim more and more lands, the high enchantress Uchawi and a small group of rebels rise from the shadows, wielding forbidden magic to challenge his oppressive regime and defy his absolute magic power.\n\nFROM THE DESTRUCTION, NEW HEROES RISE\n\nMeet the outcast heroes of Talamh, each with their unique fighting style.\nFrom the shadows of Yeldrim, Galandra emerges as an unstoppable force of nature.

Players become the robot Ropoko and must escape from a maze-like laboratory with the help of \"Doctor.\" Learn words through conversations and use the vocabulary you've acquired to solve various puzzles!\n\nThe Nintendo Switch version is an enhanced adaptation of the original MZ-700 version, improving playability with features like word selection, auto-mapping, hint functions, and gamepad support, making it easy to enjoy in any play environment.\n\n\n- Gameplay\nThough interactive fiction games are generally considered high difficulty, we've designed ROPOKO to be accessible even for those unfamiliar with the genre.\n\nMovement is handled entirely with the Joy-Con\u2122, providing smooth navigation similar to action games or RPGs.\n\nIn traditional text adventure games, players input commands as keywords to direct the character's actions. In ROPOKO, only one noun is needed to issue commands. You don't need to input verbs or objects as in conventional games; just type a noun while in contact with the target to ask questions or use items.\n\nExamples: \"ropoko,\" \"laboratory,\" \"door,\" \"wire.\"\nOnly words encountered in previous conversations can be used, so increasing your vocabulary through repeated dialogue is key to progression. Commands can be entered either by typing directly on the keyboard or selecting words using a cursor.\n\nThe game includes various puzzles, mini-games, and complex dungeons to keep players entertained. After completing the game, you can aim for the shortest completion time or the highest vocabulary score.\n\n\n- About the MZ-700\nThe MZ-700 is an 8-bit computer released by SHARP in 1982. The original version was on this machine, which lacked graphic capabilities, so the game screen is entirely represented with character graphics (pseudo-graphics made from text). Large characters, which occupy two-thirds of the screen, move smoothly thanks to machine language programming. Although the sound source can only produce single-tone beeps, ROPOKO offers 12 background music tracks and 20 types of sound effects.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1cad2ba4cf6bfac32bb281a6a385f8a8a9bb780d59397bddfe8f014d7d635eb8.jpg","id":"010094A020256000","intro":"What made the MZ-700, which couldn't even display graphics, a national computer? \nOnly the MZ-700 knows the answer...","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en"],"name":"ROPOKO for Nintendo Switch\u2122","nsuId":70010000100230,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Waku Waku Games","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251010,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6ee2610a2e61a9364471755b32f14e6cd5942e0fa56d5d5cfbb4b39bf594c36b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3d9860b6ffc4885d3232168e55fe8e60eeeb1329519acf42af3f4479892f3ab1.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4de978f1b5d826bd68d1295d4217649f053b2cddf1a26ab5e3977ed3295b45ce.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9d02a8ffac66d6af5a618e08bf2c92f2b940cfe1b9bce8ca824f8121c5c8a7f4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b45fd54d19c0d199bbb436a82d70870aa22dd5a4ee1f58f09da935c8921a89a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/56df240a5bd9483a05d8e1a3e3ebf96cca24f4aa2c520f7aa07096dce75d1dcf.jpg"],"size":279969792,"version":null},"70010000101135":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e75a006a31a9720f7137b07c407d32ff6038a11026d7c48d853dd8d003a36586.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","Puzzle"],"description":"With art inspired by classic animated movies and a story from Chris Darril (Remothered series), Bye Sweet Carole is a narrative-horror game that has you embark on a dark whimsicle tale full of mystery, intrigue and secrets.\n\nSet in the early 1900s, in an age where the women's suffrage movement has begun to shake the British nation, young Lana Benton must follow the last known trail of Carole Simmons to find her best friend and uncover the dark truth behind the Bunny Hall orphanage. \n\nAs Lana dives further into the enigma, she will find herself poised between the real world and the fantastic kingdom of Corolla that, under the cruel influence of the terrifying Mr.Kyn, the insensitive owl Velenia, and the ravenous colonies of tar rabbits, is perishing.

A mysterious figure familiar to all children in The Nowhere.

Prepare to enter a world where fear wears many faces.\n\nTwo young friends, lost in a frightening world not made for children. If they cannot find a way out of this Nowhere place, they\u2019ll be condemned to a fate worse than death. \n\nFACE YOUR CHILDHOOD FEARS TOGETHER\n\nYou play as Low and Alone, best friends ever since they found each other in this lonely nightmare. They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they\u2019ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWhether you\u2019re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you\u2019ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low\u2019s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone\u2019s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\n\nEMBARK ON AN IMMERSIVE AND DISTURBING ADVENTURE\n\nNo matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsettling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair. \n\nYou'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n\nSINK INTO THE SPIRAL\n\nDon\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere.

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era. This feature allows players to learn about Yoshiwara, even aspects that many Japanese people are unfamiliar with.

So much so that I completely forgot I'd even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.\nNow that things have finally settled down, I\u2014Yuri Mito\u2014am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.\n\nJust as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.\n\nThis is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.\nThe Tayutama Fan Disc brings you the lovey-dovey days of a couple in love!\n\n\nMain Characters\n\u25cf Mashiro Mito, VA: Risa Matsuda\nUpon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call \"\"intense\"\", and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she's not exactly human...\nMashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that's just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.\n\n\u25cf Ameri Kawai, VA: Kaori Hanano\nThe childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She's a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro. \nShe can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she's a bit on the timid side...\n\n\u25cf Mifuyu Kisaragi, VA: Rina Misaki\nShe is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls' Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She's well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn't mean she isn't without her flaws.\nShe's rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man...\n\n\u25cf Yumina Takanashi, VA: Yu Aoto\nYumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise.

This world is populated by powerful yet mostly useless wizards and strange creatures. On his journey, Simon must solve a series of tricky puzzles, operate alchemical devices, and learn powerful spells.

Combine items and clues to unravel the big mystery and become the legendary wizard you were always meant to be.   \n\nFeatures:\n\n- Official prequel to the cult series: Find out what Simon was up to just before his first magical misstep into the fantasy world, long before he started insulting talking doors. \n\n- A story with heart, humour, and a hat: Between motherly love, a forced move, and a healthy dose of chaos, Simon\u2019s journey to becoming an (unwilling) hero begins. \n\n- Hand-drawn art style & iconic voice: Featuring lovingly hand-drawn graphics and Simon\u2019s original voice, performed by British voice actor Chris Barrie, this feels like a trip back to the \u201990s, just with far better resolution. \n\n- Between magic spells and cogs: Classic point-and-click gameplay meets modern mechanics. Solve quirky puzzles, crack ancient mechanisms, and collect (as always) way too many items. \n\n- Sarcasm, slapstick, and eccentric wizards: Encounter bizarre characters, delight in even odder conversations, and revel in Simon\u2019s unmistakable wit: equal parts cheeky banter and \u201cvery British\u201d humour. \n\n- Alchemy, magic & other mishaps: Tinker with spells, fiddle with alchemical contraptions, and dabble in questionable recipes.

Help them out, and you might become friends! \n\nMore importantly, each time you die, you'll know more about Dunjungle's world, so don't despair, and use what you've learned to get further on your next adventure.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/667cab966974ab62e3781dc0d9c1a81058ede763a348ad20e30ef5652d059327.jpg","id":"0100F650239B0000","intro":"Explore, fight, die, and repeat!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Dunjungle","nsuId":70010000098350,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Astrolabe Games","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild Gambling Themes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251211,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7267a860786fc2134727544e35fea70b14b9c70de3e50e4f92849285f6b56925.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8ac5d36fa3fee4f9b74d48c8603f006e7901e604cca2d391e81f252a7bf952ef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b77ed0c8b9674514a928cd72c305ea5c4eb432c4d7415b666d5ee08c6e24bba8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fe188b5a240270b5b29a50eef8e3d55773e51d8a4ad213675d21f0d1aa15242b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ce35d8941c1b84a9fdab8bd62c79195c105601de7a27a1dda8ae70f5826b1b26.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4ce45c219b21ccd30f7d1f4b2b3de1d6ae28e7c61b7f598d20b95d9a7bdcf8ed.jpg"],"size":985661440,"version":null},"70050000056209":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5ff5505909451bdd790a6f064828e14db494673e03fc85f7df2e8476ccc13190.jpg","category":null,"description":"This DLC unlocks a brand new world for hexceed: Fuscus! \nPuzzle your way through 160 brand-new levels!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100F59014E8D01D","ids":["0100F59014E8D01D"],"intro":"Unlocks a new world for hexceed: Fuscus brings 160 new puzzles and includes all mechanics from the previous DLC.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Fuscus","nsuId":70050000056209,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"ToastieLabs","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251219,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0614e13cb3a0ae9b526c83a4305862adb45fbe03fa5f0c8d1471f0a0ff1df952.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/271fd067d61bbe5fb79025c1c814482a5803bd553479984850b348ead4a5310b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8d59e122838d92a062856b46bbfef04bec9678d77b11c3af52ab203500ce0ce2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/471cdca41d7ef644c9944b3bb065b8fbe209880dae7e4f6b32826c6374b010f3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/01bea86e7de5f4953da77dbbde70f0975fce6445a1d7f6bc45c0d1c4aa06ff6c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8825f7048b150663df85fa0163441fddcd479b9d1c1218764bbaaba54cbaa264.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000047045":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/342f8f5fdd65df2e551d102c2674da2de779ee296a4013ff199b2f3a65ffe2f7.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your Expeditions: A MudRunner Game experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"01002C101C1AB007","ids":["01002C101C1AB007"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game - Season 4","nsuId":70050000047045,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000051003":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7a50fc3b553ddb4075e3d0fe0242107cbf76b60d47f27bb9c17221ba4483fc94.jpg","category":null,"description":null,"developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Ticket to Ride: Winter","nsuId":70050000051003,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Marmalade Game Studio","rating":0,"ratingContent":["Online Interactivity","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000058810":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/178f97848d4f25054e02a3f58bb87295c1c761301b5a380afcab5ffc7011555f.jpg","category":null,"description":"This DLC grants access to 10 songs including Touhou original \"Crazy Backup Dancers\"\n\nCrazy Backup Dancers (Original Touhou Song)\nWinning Track from the Arrangement Contest: Instrumental Category\nWinning Track from the Arrangement Contest: Vocal Category\nWinning Track from the Arrangement Contest: Boss Theme Category\nA Dream Transcending Space-time\nGrip & Break down !!\nLast Occult Fantasy\nSpecial Ability to excite the Audience feat.
