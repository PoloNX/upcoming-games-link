It's a sleek, streamlined experience with just two buttons\u2014fire and bomb\u2014making it easy to pick up but hard to master. What sets the game apart is the tilt mechanic: as you turn, your shots tilt slightly left or right, allowing for strategic, angled attacks. You also have a small, satellite-like option unit that shoots independently. However, charging it requires you to release the fire button for a while, creating a tactical ebb and flow rarely seen in this all-out shoot 'em up genre.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\nThere\u2019s a big difference between an arcade game and one you play at home, and Under Defeat has gotten several new additions since its arcade debut in 2005. The New Order Mode adapts the game to a modern 16:9 format, and the game has received both sharper textures and four selectable soundtracks. This includes a brand new one from original composer Shinji Hosoe, known for his work on Ridge Racer, Tekken, Street Fighter EX, SuperSweep among many others. Of course, for an authentic experience, you can still play Under Defeat in its original arcade format. How you enjoy this bombastic action fest is entirely up to you! \n\nA BLAST FROM THE PAST\nUnder Defeat is a true classic. The game first appeared in arcades, developed by G.rev and released in Japan almost two decades ago. Over the years, it has made its way to several platforms. Most notably, it was released on the Dreamcast in 2006\u2014long after official support for the console had ended. This 2024 edition is the ultimate version of the game, containing all previous content, meticulously ported by genre veterans. \n\nNEVERENDING WAR\nUnder Defeat doesn\u2019t throw you into an incomprehensible sci-fi universe that make no sense. Instead, it offers a (mostly) realistic depiction of a futuristic past. Specifically, you play as a helicopter pilot in a drawn-out war between the German-speaking Empire and the English-speaking Union, a conflict that has raged for over a decade. Both sides are exhausted, with heavy losses on each side, yet peace remains elusive. Will this destructive conflict ever end? You'll have to play to find out!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d615b3e1f60176e1b43594db713ca8b3bc3611ed70fd06564002963d5ecfa2f9.jpg","id":"0100E1301FEDC000","intro":"FIGHT FOR PEACE IN THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF AN ALL-TIME CLASSIC!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it"],"name":"Under Defeat","nsuId":70010000084450,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Clear River Games","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250207,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80dab6c84efc51e64d3a02bd7e8cca426fcf3f47ce389a122972c59455c90ce9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/03ae49541d214fde07ee4862cda34aa2fc9680512e126a7a80aea90c06824d6b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/600a499f513c46859446b66c65ae496f8928c2db94efe994e3f12c265d2701c3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cafacf52f1064941c40d522e4fdf576a69c481d020e625365f8933959f085810.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f88370f0981c24397f3b7e63b0ab692f19383f9996d0b89f965bddb2f1c3726d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9ff0f07f4fe0d481a38311b80aa5a9a4eaf7723d911fcf9f61c5a6ead3190106.jpg"],"size":347078656,"version":null},"70010000087088":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9495dee1cdfedc00bd983962e59344aa732cb09de16ce099bd58b54505c396c3.jpg","category":["Adventure","Simulation","RPG","Puzzle"],"description":"Solve mysteries, find the lost, help people in trouble, track down criminals and save lives as Biscuit, the one-and-only doggo detective!

This made every playthrough (attempt) feel different and unique.\n\nIn 2024 the highly challenging underwater shoot \u2018em up from the game development legends at Rainbow Arts is finally returning.\nININ and Ziggurat have collaborated to bring you a faithful remake completely rebuilt from the ground up and greatly improved.\n\nRedrawn:\nThe impressive sprite work of yesteryear has not only been remade into even more impressive modern high-resolution sprites but also greatly expanded upon with particle and lighting effects. 8 varied stages, the enemies, the bosses, the ships, the projectiles\u2014everything shines in a brand-new light!\n\nRemixed:\nApart from the visual journey of each playthrough, you\u2019ll embark on a musical one as well: epic synth soundscapes that drive you forward by the magnificent Chris H\u00fclsbeck. In addition to him remastering his original works, we have created six entirely new tracks as well.\n\nRemembered:\nAnd it's not just Chris H\u00fclsbeck who has returned for this remake: Ogan Kandemiroglu, the brother and co-artist of Celal Kandemiroglu who created the original iconic key art of X-Out, took on that task for the remake as a tribute.\n\nRe-equipped:\nThe shop system is back and thoroughly improved as well: new preconfigured load-outs allow you to jump straight into the action, added item descriptions help new cadets configure and build their fleet, and we've FINALLY marked the available slots for your weaponry.\n\nReinforced:\nShould you still feel overwhelmed by X-Out\u2019s challenge, then maybe it\u2019s time for a co-captain. Enlist a friend and face the terrors from the ocean deep together in the local 2-player co-op mode!\n\nReversed:\nIf you think you\u2019ve seen everything there is to the game already, then prepare to have your bearing changed and your gyro twisted in the Mirror Mode with its reverse-scrolling levels!\n\nRecapped:\n\u2022 Experience a fresh but faithful take on a real shoot-\u2019em-up classic!\n\u2022 Get dazzled by the new and beautiful sprite work mixed with shiny particle and lighting effects!\n\u2022 Take a journey through new and old synth soundscapes courtesy of composer legend Chris H\u00fclsbeck!\n\u2022 Choose one of three load-outs or build your own fleet in the improved shop system!\n\u2022 Grab a trusty ally and face the depths together in a 2-player couch co-op dive!\n\u2022 Get your world flipped, turned upside down in the Mirror Mode!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0d4de6fefb16837f6844cb403c5968c02c177d4d7aa3618982f18b15baa3ae50.jpg","id":"010048501F73E000","intro":"Relive the deep-sea classic!
