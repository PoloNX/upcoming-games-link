So much so that I completely forgot I'd even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.\nNow that things have finally settled down, I\u2014Yuri Mito\u2014am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.\n\nJust as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.\n\nThis is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.\nThe Tayutama Fan Disc brings you the lovey-dovey days of a couple in love!\n\n\nMain Characters\n\u25cf Mashiro Mito, VA: Risa Matsuda\nUpon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call \"\"intense\"\", and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she's not exactly human...\nMashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that's just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.\n\n\u25cf Ameri Kawai, VA: Kaori Hanano\nThe childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She's a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro. \nShe can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she's a bit on the timid side...\n\n\u25cf Mifuyu Kisaragi, VA: Rina Misaki\nShe is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls' Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She's well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn't mean she isn't without her flaws.\nShe's rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man...\n\n\u25cf Yumina Takanashi, VA: Yu Aoto\nYumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise. Unfortunately, Mari Mito, the family matron, passes away long before the start of our story, and Yumina is ultimately adopted to the Takanashi family out of concern of a lack of mother figure.\nShe's one of those people who immediately fails at a task whenever someone is watching out of nervousness. But she doesn't mind working hard, and she's actually rather good at handling the household chores. She tends to get lost in her own imagination. \n\n\u25cf Nue, VA: Mika\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nShe transformed into a human-like form over 500 years ago, but due to some unknown incident, lost her memory and has remained that way ever since.\nAfter Mifuyu offered to become her guardian, she quickly grew attached and now brings a cheerful, innocent energy that puts everyone at ease.\n\n\u25cf Ouryu, VA: Taiyo Sorano\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nOnce thought to see humans as nothing more than prey, it turns out the truth is quite the opposite\u2014he simply envisioned a different kind of coexistence from Mashiro.\nThough he usually hides in the pond in the Kawai family\u2019s garden, he often takes human form to walk among people.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0934a67c1194fd5500aa7e387f2d23aad5f551c7de86168d1756dcfc1bdeb745.jpg","id":"0100A13022F30000","intro":"This is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh","zh"],"name":"Tayutama:It's happy days","nsuId":70010000095543,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Frontier Works","rating":15,"ratingContent":["Sexualised Imagery"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251023,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/220f03a24f8768494a018765234f63ef2e74c1541fff80140ea7f9a9fa396299.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a710dd613e65e684d484c1a6ec883fbc89694a36f3fbeb01b433710395756425.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/72cb8f79cd774dfec75cf5dc0d6db16f1b0f678b21322ed0c1bc64375c06e139.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/63fc0f96b3db6ac51e2474385540ac9ce63c99ab78d99ebb405c52c8cf11477a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c56d96620dfe6ae3a3ebc479c1a092d1692030233b49036f4fb549d6fcd40857.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f9fca505631eb6d8f95bc5f9da34c96553b167c3559f3090df5c1a221ad921ef.jpg"],"size":4083154944,"version":null},"70010000100771":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d1131210439302b38ae85e3a75e4c81291987295c9455150f226023174997eca.jpg","category":["Action","Fighting","Platformer","Arcade"],"description":"This 2.5D action platformer throws you into shiny armor with a very big blaster \u2014 and lets you move exactly how you want.

Your challenge is to organise the pieces of these animals, along with logs, stones, and bushes, to fill the board without letting rivalry disturb the harmony.\n\nEach piece has a unique shape and can be freely rotated, but beware: if a wolf ends up next to a capybara, a fight occurs and your last move disappears. This is where strategy comes in, using terrain as a natural barrier to create the perfect balance.\n\nThere are 30 levels ranging from cosy tutorials to challenging puzzles, with extra goals such as using more capybara pieces than wolf pieces or limiting the number of each clan.

As the galaxy's (soon to be) premiere chef, it's up to you to seek out the finest ingredients from alien planets, cook delicious dishes, and serve them to customers in the comfort of your fully-customisable space trailer.\n\nExplore Alien Worlds\nThere's a whole universe of ingredients out there... if they don't eat you first. Explore distant planets, derelict space stations, and your own basement for plants, critters, and other tasty morsels.\n\nAlong the way, you'll come across space pirates, ancient ruins, and a suspiciously high number of recently abandoned restaurants. Keep an eye out for rare resources (and bits of random junk) that you can use to upgrade your gear, kitchen equipment, and spaceship.\n\nCook Up Cosmic Creations\nOnce your fridge is stocked with ingredients that have (mostly) stopped wriggling, it's time to flip the sign and start serving!\n\nCraft over 140 different dishes, from simple homestyle Beefle Skewers to the legendarily tricky Octoegg Surprise. Wow your customers with delicious food and speedy service, and you\u2019ll earn the Astronomical Culinary Excellence Stars that mark your path to intergalactic culinary success.\n\nAs your reputation grows, the customers start coming to you! Keep it flexible by continuing your delivery service or open up a sit-in restaurant with a constant flow of patrons. You're free to close the kitchen whenever adventure calls.\n\nSet a Stellar Ambiance\nYour space-trailer might not look too sharp from the outside, but she's got it where it counts. Take complete control of your interior with freely placeable decorations and an in-depth coloring system to create the restaurant of your dreams.

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\n\nNow 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!\n\nThe original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian and Spanish.
