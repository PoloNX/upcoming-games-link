Become stronger still with powerful Boons from more than a dozen Olympian gods, from Apollo to Zeus. There are nearly limitless ways to build your abilities.\n\nMINGLE WITH (MORE) GODS, GHOSTS, AND MONSTERS\nMeet a cast of dozens of fully-voiced, larger-than-life characters, including plenty of new faces and some old friends. Grow closer to them through a variety of new interactions, and experience countless unique story events based on how your journey unfolds.\n\nEVERY RUN IS ITS OWN ADVENTURE\nNew locations, challenges, upgrade systems, and surprises await as you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld again and again. Reveal the mysteries of the Arcana Altar, tame witchy familiars, and gather reagents using Tools of the Unseen to get closer to your goal.\n\nTHE PERKS OF IMMORTALITY\nThanks to a variety of permanent upgrades and the return of God Mode, you don't have to be a god yourself to experience what Hades II has to offer. But if you happen to be one, you can brave escalating challenges for greater rewards, and prove just how divine you really are.\n\nSIGNATURE SUPERGIANT STYLE\nRich, atmospheric presentation and storytelling fused with responsive action is the hallmark of Supergiant's titles.

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era. This feature allows players to learn about Yoshiwara, even aspects that many Japanese people are unfamiliar with. Additionally, the game supports English and Simplified Chinese, enabling players from different language regions to explore and learn about Japan\u2019s Edo period.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/18b8e1558f9af283c908914584dac0fdc624ad2c8db8b26b2fd9361e8a4d9b8d.jpg","id":"0100D14021E4A000","intro":"A Time loop mystery set in Japan\u2019s Edo period!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh"],"name":"GHOST TRAVELER: Adventures in Edo","nsuId":70010000097777,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"SUCCESS","rating":18,"ratingContent":["References to Sexual Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251016,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de6f4dad0480e5705c8f3e93d1ba0fe377afb688f91259cbc8a3fa63e068ca9e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/25e88f73150091b2b86dc3c6d9164075a149de6e1780865ce5e049a5ad95db1a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a21b5fd243cd30eda0f2a9c3604965876bed8bcf2ea5906eee0733db58a1d66c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2d4203bd9d7fba4f2582a2457337e34059c0c19ae063e84038ab74c944024c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a890c1da6f7356a724f82461bc79ee808bcea193a035dafd4c2a2e3e34762f10.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1ae2395cbd2852e932e3116e0d0e49e26c2392054dba66863566a1fba2567344.jpg"],"size":2091909120,"version":null},"70010000099366":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/770dc64c402c949be24c2cfe319cfd0eb4181ec18c7077122d8deaedbf6e23d5.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","RPG"],"description":"An urban redevelopment plan is underway in Lumiose City!

So much so that I completely forgot I'd even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.\nNow that things have finally settled down, I\u2014Yuri Mito\u2014am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.\n\nJust as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.\n\nThis is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.\nThe Tayutama Fan Disc brings you the lovey-dovey days of a couple in love!\n\n\nMain Characters\n\u25cf Mashiro Mito, VA: Risa Matsuda\nUpon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call \"\"intense\"\", and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she's not exactly human...\nMashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that's just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.\n\n\u25cf Ameri Kawai, VA: Kaori Hanano\nThe childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She's a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro. \nShe can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she's a bit on the timid side...\n\n\u25cf Mifuyu Kisaragi, VA: Rina Misaki\nShe is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls' Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She's well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn't mean she isn't without her flaws.\nShe's rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man...\n\n\u25cf Yumina Takanashi, VA: Yu Aoto\nYumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise. Unfortunately, Mari Mito, the family matron, passes away long before the start of our story, and Yumina is ultimately adopted to the Takanashi family out of concern of a lack of mother figure.\nShe's one of those people who immediately fails at a task whenever someone is watching out of nervousness. But she doesn't mind working hard, and she's actually rather good at handling the household chores. She tends to get lost in her own imagination. \n\n\u25cf Nue, VA: Mika\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nShe transformed into a human-like form over 500 years ago, but due to some unknown incident, lost her memory and has remained that way ever since.\nAfter Mifuyu offered to become her guardian, she quickly grew attached and now brings a cheerful, innocent energy that puts everyone at ease.\n\n\u25cf Ouryu, VA: Taiyo Sorano\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nOnce thought to see humans as nothing more than prey, it turns out the truth is quite the opposite\u2014he simply envisioned a different kind of coexistence from Mashiro.\nThough he usually hides in the pond in the Kawai family\u2019s garden, he often takes human form to walk among people.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0934a67c1194fd5500aa7e387f2d23aad5f551c7de86168d1756dcfc1bdeb745.jpg","id":"0100A13022F30000","intro":"This is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh","zh"],"name":"Tayutama:It's happy days","nsuId":70010000095543,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Frontier Works","rating":15,"ratingContent":["Sexualised Imagery"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251023,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/220f03a24f8768494a018765234f63ef2e74c1541fff80140ea7f9a9fa396299.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a710dd613e65e684d484c1a6ec883fbc89694a36f3fbeb01b433710395756425.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/72cb8f79cd774dfec75cf5dc0d6db16f1b0f678b21322ed0c1bc64375c06e139.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/63fc0f96b3db6ac51e2474385540ac9ce63c99ab78d99ebb405c52c8cf11477a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c56d96620dfe6ae3a3ebc479c1a092d1692030233b49036f4fb549d6fcd40857.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f9fca505631eb6d8f95bc5f9da34c96553b167c3559f3090df5c1a221ad921ef.jpg"],"size":4083154944,"version":null},"70010000102673":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/65b54ed858a8907e288e1813afcfb85cb4a63f975bacc8ca43d7a6f8a4c7870a.jpg","category":["Strategy","Simulation"],"description":"Bring an end to the ancient conflict between light and darkness!\nRule over your own fantasy realm.

This world is populated by powerful yet mostly useless wizards and strange creatures. On his journey, Simon must solve a series of tricky puzzles, operate alchemical devices, and learn powerful spells. And yes, he also has to taste a few disgusting stews! \n\nPuzzles, Magic, and Simon\u2019s Humor \n\nWhether you're visiting the Magical World for the first time or returning once again \u2013 Simon is back, along with his unique sense of humor and a completely new graphic style. Simon the Sorcerer Origins brings the charm of the original saga back in a completely hand-drawn graphic style, blending classic gameplay mechanics with a fresh, new world of magic. \n\nYour Adventure, Your Puzzles \n\nSolve loads of tricky puzzles, test your wits, and face a variety of absurd situations and quirky characters. Combine items and clues to unravel the big mystery and become the legendary wizard you were always meant to be.   \n\nFeatures:\n\n- Official prequel to the cult series: Find out what Simon was up to just before his first magical misstep into the fantasy world, long before he started insulting talking doors. \n\n- A story with heart, humour, and a hat: Between motherly love, a forced move, and a healthy dose of chaos, Simon\u2019s journey to becoming an (unwilling) hero begins. \n\n- Hand-drawn art style & iconic voice: Featuring lovingly hand-drawn graphics and Simon\u2019s original voice, performed by British voice actor Chris Barrie, this feels like a trip back to the \u201990s, just with far better resolution. \n\n- Between magic spells and cogs: Classic point-and-click gameplay meets modern mechanics. Solve quirky puzzles, crack ancient mechanisms, and collect (as always) way too many items. \n\n- Sarcasm, slapstick, and eccentric wizards: Encounter bizarre characters, delight in even odder conversations, and revel in Simon\u2019s unmistakable wit: equal parts cheeky banter and \u201cvery British\u201d humour. \n\n- Alchemy, magic & other mishaps: Tinker with spells, fiddle with alchemical contraptions, and dabble in questionable recipes.
