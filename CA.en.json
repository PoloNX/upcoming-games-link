Get ready to experience the cutest and most fun sports game you've ever played. With colorful graphics, adorable characters, and exciting gameplay, you'll have a blast competing in various sports activities. Let's play!\n\nLOCAL MULTIPLAYER\nYou can play with up to 4 people, making it perfect for game nights, family gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. Choose your characters, divide into two teams and prepare for endless hours of fun and laughter for everyone.\n\nNO RULES!\nEach sport has a set of rules to decide how points are scored... but nothing about how player should behave\u2026 So, feel free to block the basket, stun the opponent, block their way or invade the opponent's field!\n\nRANDOMLY GENERATED TERRAIN\nImagine playing a sports game where every time you start a new game, you encounter a completely new terrain. No match will ever be the same again!. Adapt your strategies to the ever-changing terrain to become the ultimate champion!\n\nSEVEN BALL SPORTS\nEnjoy playing classic sports like soccer or basketball and also discover other cultural sports like Pelota Vasca or Ulama that are not so well known but just as fun! Create championships choosing the sports you like the most and show your skills!\n\n- Soccer\nA classic, two goals and two teams. Whoever puts the ball into the opposing team's goal the most times wins. Take advantage of the curves and mushrooms in the environment to gain position or hit from higher.\n\n- Basket\nThis game consists of putting the ball through the opponent's metal hoop and is played with the hands... well, not in this case... Our friends have adapted it a bit to play... with the head... and huge wooden baskets!\n\n- American Football\nRunning after a strange shaped ball and hitting the opponent to take it away is a sport. Yes, and it is very intense. Grab the egg shaped ball and take it to a safe area avoiding being caught! Kick it if you are in trouble!\n\n- Tennis\nA sport where players try to hit a small, yellow ball over a net, without hitting it too hard or too soft. It's like a beautiful dance, but with more shouting and the occasional racquet smash. And good luck finding that little yellow ball in the bushes.\n\n- Volley Ball\nPass the ball to the field of the opposing team. In this case you can use the net both to bounce the ball and to climb on it with the help of the jumping mushrooms.\n\n- Basque Pelota\nHitting a rock-hard ball with your hand to send it against a wall? Yes, and it's really attractive! It is played in turns and each time the ball hits the wall, the team that serves changes. Be careful not to send it too low or too high.\n\n- Ulama\nWhat? Have you never heard of Ulama? Listen and enjoy. A traditional game in the Mayan culture that is played with the hips! Invade opponent field with the ball. In Narona you also play with your head. A huge ring on the wall means that if you pass the ball through it you get 5 points! Frankly fun!\n\nCUTE CHARACTERS\nFive girls and five boys are the brave ones who have gone out to the forests of Narona to play and have fun. With different speed, strength and jump force, each one takes advantage of its skills in each sport. The smart girl, the lazy boy, the big guy, the jock, the music fan, the strong one, the scared little one, the handsome and nice guy and the weird girl with the tattoos... there's room for everyone!\n\nSKINS AND REWARDS\nCustomize your experience by unlocking different skins for each character.

Players take on the role of Adol Christin, a red-haired adventurer, as he embarks on a journey to seek the six Books of Ys.\n\nAt the time of its release, the PC gaming industry was saturated with challenging RPGs. However, Nihon Falcom took a different approach with this game, releasing it with the concept of \"Now, it's the era to bring kindness in RPGs,\" aiming to create an RPG that everyone could enjoy.\n\nThe game features clever level-up settings that eliminate the hassle of grinding for experience points, the removal of unreasonable traps, and agile characters that move smoothly. With numerous thoughtful design choices, the game can be enjoyed comfortably, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it is filled with \"kindness,\" as the tagline suggests.\n\nThe MSX2 version differs from the original in several ways, including modified graphics for shops and changes to boss attacks (such as the number of scythes wielded by Pictimos). Additionally, the BGM uses PSG sound, with some tracks replaced by PSG-exclusive compositions. By paying attention to these differences, you might discover new aspects of Ys that add to its charm.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/36ca8765b8a383ab5b3dc63f5b9e8a8ce4297136e8ecc529f6ff5849e46c0f9c.jpg","id":"0100B72020AF4000","intro":"The landmark first game of an ongoing popular title.

Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070243,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mild Language","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70050000052466":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/786f0b737d8892c7c2af512af6ca42dcde85fc2928287d590ce5347078fb8f1f.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enjoy a new original scenario, including new quests and stories.\n\nNote:\n- This product is scheduled to become available by the end of January 2025.\n\n- Content can be accessed after reaching a designated point in the game.\n- The details and release dates of any content may be changed with no notice.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
