The game aims to give you a sense of liberation and lightness, offering the perfect retreat to unwind after a busy day and leave behind the rush of the outside world.\nOne of the unique features of this game is that you can select the level that best suits your desire to relax. The levels are designed to be completed quickly, so you can enjoy a short break if you're looking for a brief moment of peace. However, if you have more time and wish to explore, you can take a slower pace and dive deeper into the environment. This flexibility allows you to choose the experience that fits your needs, whether it's a short moment of calm or a longer, more immersive journey.\nThe game showcases a beautiful collection of some of the most stunning landscapes from the Aery franchise. These carefully crafted sceneries offer a visual oasis of tranquility, ranging from majestic mountains and vast forests to peaceful lakes and endless skies. Each scene is designed not only to delight the eyes but also to create an atmosphere of calm that invites you to relax.\nWe hope you enjoy the beautiful landscapes and that they help you unwind and find peace.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","pt","en","fr","de","zh","zh"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086482,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000046105":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df5e52844738f32f17e1654480187020ced34f51e902672540af805ea857719d.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7026","ids":["0100FBD013AB7026"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 15: Oil & Dirt","nsuId":70050000046105,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Users Interact"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000046109":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8e22033788d5f9c44aeb0820db8814c5ae1712b4c7898dc2f3eee21b26b4ead.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7027","ids":["0100FBD013AB7027"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 16: Expansion 4","nsuId":70050000046109,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Users Interact"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000046223":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/233d71ca26ac382d7ab9a8e48c5fb4e2656687c72e59189588fc6e288b42a5d6.jpg","category":null,"description":"Get another Melee Weapon and more cosmetic items.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SOUTH PARK: SNOW DAY!
