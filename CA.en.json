After the unsuccessful use, the irrepressible book returns to its author from the other world, uncontrollably summoning horrifying monsters. The only salvation is to stop the book and prevent evil forces from taking over the world.\nBosorka is an exciting action game that combines the best elements of the roguelike and shoot'em up genres with incredibly stylized top-down 3D visualization. Immerse yourself in this dark fantasy world and show the demons who's the power to be reckoned with.\n\nExciting journeys to various locations!\nSeveral huge levels are generated from manually created parts. Each level is an independent biome with its own unique atmosphere, mysteries and dangerous creatures. Secret rooms, hidden passages, breathtaking landscapes, and lots of valuable things that can be encountered in unexpected places provide a real incentive to explore the environment.\n\nBosses from the netherworld!\nAt the end of each level, you will meet powerful monsters that guard the passages to the next locations, preventing you from following the book. Each monster has an exceptional set of uncanny abilities and is capable of incinerating you in an instant, so one should be well prepared for this encounter.\n\nCompanion Demons!\nIn the midst of a circle of evil demons, there may be renegades who have not been affected by evil spells and have no bad intentions. Lovely creatures, surprisingly loyal to those who save them. Raise an entire army of companions who will help you in the fight against the enemy. Some of them have marvelous abilities that will definitely come in handy.\n\nCaution! Dangerous Spells!\nDestroy enemy hordes of evil creatures by means of powerful spells. Burn, freeze, strike with incredible lightning bolts, or pelt everyone with slimy frogs \u2014 there're various spells to suit every taste. Mysterious mirrors hidden in different corners of these regions will reveal to you new spells to defend this world from. Find them and develop the tactics to wipe out the evil.\n\nAmazing combinations of collected items!\nStrong health, protective shell, poisonous touch or a deadly whirlwind around you, and perhaps even more. Make your own unique collection of runes. Each rune performs only one function, but the combination of several of them can significantly change the entire gameplay, turning you into a real natural calamity. And now, who is hunting who?\n\nExciting flight on a broomstick!\nAn enchanted witch's broom is not only a means of transportation. Each broom has its own specialty and is capable of a great deal more than just flying.

Scout your environments and send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and ancient artefacts. \n\nResearch new technologies\nRemnants of the old world hold knowledge that has long been forgotten, but can be unearthed by your villagers.
