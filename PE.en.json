Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners - plagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair - pool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape.\n\nEscape the Monastery\nEscaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more. \n\nExplore your surroundings and combine the characters\u2019 abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you\u2019re caught being somewhere you shouldn\u2019t be, the guards will not be kind.\n\nManage the Madness\nTo effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters' mental health.\n\nEach playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character\u2019s sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played.\n\nDiscover the Secrets Within\nChoose from two different escape plans to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises. \n\nTime is continuous in The Stone of Madness. Actions have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions.\n \nSneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters\u2019 sanity.\n \nNighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about. But sometimes, the risk is worth the reward. \n\nExperience a Stunning Hand-Painted Art Style\n\nThe visuals in The Stone of Madness have been lovingly hand-painted and animated frame by frame, drawing heavy inspiration from 18th-century artist Francisco De Goya.\n\nThe game's isometric perspective acts as the perfect showcase for the eye-catching visuals, allowing players to observe every minute detail and feel as if they\u2019re adventuring through a Goya painting brought to life.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/dad07380a7d7aff137783d17e0be15b1a5f987fa802da3e0132deffa9738a37a.jpg","id":"01000F101B672000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"The Stone of Madness","nsuId":70010000067216,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Tripwire Interactive","rating":17,"ratingContent":["Blood","Nudity","Sexual Content","Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250128,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/279f7343393102472189a6f8c67983443c6e8dccba5815041ffb94872949a367.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7c1a915a789152fe55cae78db46cf5d18c6f9cf51be32d59a55a1cfee2df94e7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3af5499423967988c56494cff2f747aa9a1e5fe20882858cb838deb06e2fbb0e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aa18df3187e6bfdac5d9b40f85350cdcf6b7ea1b7548cfbc25960bb19d132b60.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d02fe81b7878ab34fb5bdd67043ad8720efad5e13ff804e6530bd56d7802cf1b.jpg"],"size":2479882240,"version":null},"70010000075730":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c7be946602ed5830bdfaa52aaf0aa7143686953b11c75e54b7f59a42fe2785ef.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","RPG"],"description":"Just as the Rats of the South start to piece their lives together, following the great war between Rodent and Frog, an old and unspeakable evil stirs in the North; wings black as death; fangs sharp as steel; and a thirst for blood rivalled only by their insatiable hunger\u2026 for vengeance.  \n\nAs Arlo, young heir to the Warden of the Wastes, journey through the vast, snow-ravaged lands of the North in an epic quest to overcome the Dark Wings once and for all.

All resources obtained through repairing the land can then be used to design the world to your liking! The medley of genres in this RPG is surprisingly accessible to players of all types, but there's no shortage of challenging elements, too! A variety of activities and a vast world lie ahead. It's up to you to repair what has been destroyed and restore peace.\n\n\nA Sprawling Overworld\n\nOur adventure takes place in the distant continent of Noahtun, a region rich in land and sea with various seasons. As you move through the overworld, the land will materialize where you advance. What awaits in the untouched regions of the world? New encounters? Battles? Perhaps an instance of fragmentation? Find out for yourself by traveling to every corner of the land.\n\n\nPuzzles\n\nRestoration Puzzles are a mission exclusive to the Restorer. By clearing the puzzle, the fragmentation of the land is then eliminated, restoring the land to its former state.\n\n\n\"Map-Crafting\"\n\nIf the land has not been afflicted with fragmentation, it can be developed to have farmland, buildings, and other facilities so you can harvest crops and various resources. As you develop the land, more resources can be obtained and even stores can be accessed. Once a certain number of facilities have been established and the area is enclosed by fences, walls, or gates, it will become a village or town and you can give it a unique name.\n\n\nBattle\n\nA variety of monsters may appear in the land you explore. They can harm or damage the land they occupy, so be sure to take care of them with the help of your teammates. When battle commences, your teammates will attack automatically. Your role as the Restorer will be to grant Mana to them throughout the battles duration. Through granting them Mana, the skill sets in their weapons will be charged, eventually allowing them to perform an extra powerful attack.\n\n\nStory\n\nLong ago...\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, the world suddenly began to fall to pieces, fragmenting into cubes. Amidst the disaster many lives were lost, and spawned from this calamity came natural disasters, decimating all land and water. \n\nThe balance of the world was offset, and people's lives were forever changed.\nThe disastrous phenomenon that reduces the land to cubes, what became known as the \"fragmentation\", \ncontinued to spread throughout the world with no signs of stopping.\n\nTo restore the order of the world, the goddess Chroem selected an individual to fulfill the role of \"Restorer\", the one who would restore the lands. They were tasked to journey across the world and rebuild all that had been destroyed.\n\nThe tale of our Restorer, begins now.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/72a2393c014ffb66f3fa4335605762069ea8bed1f944016a39ac5337a3aea0e1.jpg","id":"01008B40212D2000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"KAMiBAKO","nsuId":70010000089660,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Gravity","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence","Mild Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250130,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/46db4518720181408a4e2207b807a89dc3d42004b31a3d293dc07352de7174a9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/22cfe02e2f5875acc822acd52010b3453cf1bbb71d7e74b2309b776c9e1f017a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/837ecf30c11a95f5f5decb6c92e62c6a73c6c8631822fe701854386a7f9cf831.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/74901aade37f5fbbf10f04b54ced0e9846a38ed8b7fec67b16bd73558c66d0a3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b8ee7fa81c3ee62746adffa913e4f84ebcc3ce81817211bcd744f9756e99814b.jpg"],"size":2612002816,"version":null},"70010000089669":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c2e682af3ca7b8938484578736541e6098a002de8a4493d9f1e4b8791f1679c9.jpg","category":["Action","Platformer","Arcade"],"description":"Simple but addictive gameplay.

heads.\u201d\n\nEvery 25 years, horrifying events occur in a lost town in the south. For one week, August 1-7, referred to as \u201cdeath week,\u201d teenagers mysteriously disappear. City officials have long ago given up on the mystery and are simply closing missing persons cases, advising residents to stock up on essential supplies and not to leave their homes. But even such measures don't save the day, and more people go missing every year. Is a serial killer, who has passed his craft from generation to generation, to blame for these terrible disappearances, or ... or ... Is it a curse?\n\nThe protagonist is John, a diligent senior year student with a passion for video blogging. On August 1, 2017, exactly one month before his coming of age, a new \u201cweek of death\u201d arrives. The townspeople are busy going about their business and seem to have already forgotten about the curse, but John receives a tempting offer from his friend Will: to explore the long-abandoned house of a deceased old lady who once instilled terror in all the residents.\n\nFeatures:\n\n-Photo-realistic graphics\n-Realistic gameplay\n-High-quality audio accompaniment, creating an atmosphere of maximum fear\n-Unpredictable gameplay: the abandoned house will change as the game progresses, creating new obstacles and puzzles for the player.\n-Learn the ancient history of a provincial town and solve the mystery of mystical disappearances of children\n\nImmerse yourself in this fascinating world and find out what lies behind the eerie events of the \u201cdeath week\u201d.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9b2b5a13411277b0db03a06c14adfd4569fd00683cb756ab4a2b70e047105df6.jpg","id":"01003A0021DA2000","intro":"In a remote provincial town, teenagers mysteriously disappear every 25 years.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud.

It's a sleek, streamlined experience with just two buttons\u2014fire and bomb\u2014making it easy to pick up but hard to master. What sets the game apart is the tilt mechanic: as you turn, your shots tilt slightly left or right, allowing for strategic, angled attacks. You also have a small, satellite-like option unit that shoots independently. However, charging it requires you to release the fire button for a while, creating a tactical ebb and flow rarely seen in this all-out shoot 'em up genre.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\nThere\u2019s a big difference between an arcade game and one you play at home, and Under Defeat has gotten several new additions since its arcade debut in 2005. The New Order Mode adapts the game to a modern 16:9 format, and the game has received both sharper textures and four selectable soundtracks. This includes a brand new one from original composer Shinji Hosoe, known for his work on Ridge Racer, Tekken, Street Fighter EX, SuperSweep among many others. Of course, for an authentic experience, you can still play Under Defeat in its original arcade format. How you enjoy this bombastic action fest is entirely up to you! \n\nA BLAST FROM THE PAST\nUnder Defeat is a true classic. The game first appeared in arcades, developed by G.rev and released in Japan almost two decades ago. Over the years, it has made its way to several platforms. Most notably, it was released on the Dreamcast in 2006\u2014long after official support for the console had ended. This 2024 edition is the ultimate version of the game, containing all previous content, meticulously ported by genre veterans. \n\nNEVERENDING WAR\nUnder Defeat doesn\u2019t throw you into an incomprehensible sci-fi universe that make no sense. Instead, it offers a (mostly) realistic depiction of a futuristic past. Specifically, you play as a helicopter pilot in a drawn-out war between the German-speaking Empire and the English-speaking Union, a conflict that has raged for over a decade. Both sides are exhausted, with heavy losses on each side, yet peace remains elusive. Will this destructive conflict ever end? You'll have to play to find out!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d615b3e1f60176e1b43594db713ca8b3bc3611ed70fd06564002963d5ecfa2f9.jpg","id":"0100E1301FEDC000","intro":"FIGHT FOR PEACE IN THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF AN ALL-TIME CLASSIC!\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it"],"name":"Under Defeat","nsuId":70010000084449,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Clear River Games","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Mild Suggestive Themes","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250206,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80dab6c84efc51e64d3a02bd7e8cca426fcf3f47ce389a122972c59455c90ce9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/03ae49541d214fde07ee4862cda34aa2fc9680512e126a7a80aea90c06824d6b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/600a499f513c46859446b66c65ae496f8928c2db94efe994e3f12c265d2701c3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cafacf52f1064941c40d522e4fdf576a69c481d020e625365f8933959f085810.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f88370f0981c24397f3b7e63b0ab692f19383f9996d0b89f965bddb2f1c3726d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9ff0f07f4fe0d481a38311b80aa5a9a4eaf7723d911fcf9f61c5a6ead3190106.jpg"],"size":364904448,"version":null},"70010000087192":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/811d59acb0a6fcf5671684046b234423b0ba10e447766b382655748eb9618f26.jpg","category":["Arcade","Puzzle","Shooter","Board Game"],"description":"The ultimate marble shooter game combines puzzle-solving skills with fast-paced action.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
