Make the best of the space studio you own. Create art with a large variety of tools, sell your works, get famous and upgrade your studio! Let your imagination run wild and create the art of your dreams!\n\nPAINT EVERYWHERE\nTurn the world around you into a huge canvas and do whatever you please with it \u2014 add some red to that gloomy wall, spill paint on the floor and call it abstract expressionism, or start a collection of alphabet paintings from A to Z: this place is yours after all! Wait, how did you mess up your studio that much that fast?\n\nUPGRADE AND DESIGN YOUR STUDIO\nNot satisfied with the initial look and/or functionality of your studio? That\u2019s okay, because you can always unlock new rooms, buy some furniture and decorations, and place those however and wherever you want \u2014 make yourself at home! Wait, what do you mean you don\u2019t have enough money?!\n\nSELL AND EXPOSE YOUR ART\nSell your paintings at the marketplace, fulfill all your clients' orders, and receive a generous reward, or maybe a gift! Or maybe some exposure, the best of all currencies out there. Don't forget that you can exhibit your amazing art and see what critics have to say about it.\n\nREALISTIC PAINTING\nPainting in SuchArt feels just like in real life, but without the downsides. The colors mix as you would naturally expect them to, so you can easily achieve the result you dreamed about. The paint has realistic texture, and each instrument alters it a bit with different strokes. There\u2019s plenty of instruments to choose from: brushes, palette knives, stencils or even flamethrowers to create your next masterpiece.\n\nPICK YOUR SIDE\nThey say down on Earth the robots are revolting and the Crabuxes covet the planet\u2019s saltwater.

So much so that I completely forgot I'd even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.\nNow that things have finally settled down, I\u2014Yuri Mito\u2014am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.\n\nJust as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.\n\nThis is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.\nThe Tayutama Fan Disc brings you the lovey-dovey days of a couple in love!\n\n\nMain Characters\n\u25cf Mashiro Mito, VA: Risa Matsuda\nUpon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call \"\"intense\"\", and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she's not exactly human...\nMashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that's just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.\n\n\u25cf Ameri Kawai, VA: Kaori Hanano\nThe childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She's a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro. \nShe can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she's a bit on the timid side...\n\n\u25cf Mifuyu Kisaragi, VA: Rina Misaki\nShe is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls' Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She's well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn't mean she isn't without her flaws.\nShe's rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man...\n\n\u25cf Yumina Takanashi, VA: Yu Aoto\nYumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise.

Achieving these goals grants special stars, but you can progress smoothly even without them.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0dc3878f75699685af8b497e30393100019c6b3c27583cad749ef8fcef42164a.jpg","id":"01008F40250AA000","intro":"When Wolves Meet Capybaras","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","pt"],"name":"Claim The Forest","nsuId":70010000104653,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Afil Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251023,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b8accc0390078fc5e5cc123b9afa74eea2c33dce7be0024bc7e23392147ce872.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1877feba25c29a5ed25b0008c6ae1a131cec15cec802f8689930ad33eb72ab1f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b8ca9db4d1492f9f5b95d77e7cdb3fb5a81e96102b9e6a65a7d33ef65508f87.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/359568d78df93f89d346689325eb147808b9407936952eb9df9b0006e460dfe8.jpg"],"size":116391936,"version":null},"70010000105251":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8990592468889a13e3cefc82417105863741c6aa4553aeee37b91f2dcb1106b0.jpg","category":["Arcade","Party","Puzzle","Communication"],"description":"Let's make authentic udon on the Nintendo Switch\u2122!\nWhip up bowls of udon noodles both hot and cold as quickly and accurately as you can!\nShare Joy-Con\u2122 for exciting battles with up to 4 players!\nReach for the ultimate high score!\n\n\u300aRules\u300b\nMake and serve as many bowls of udon as you can before time runs out!\nBoil the noodles, pour the broth, then add the right toppings!\nDon't forget to watch the portion sizes, and fill each order correctly!\n\n\u300aHow to Play\u300b\n1.

As the galaxy's (soon to be) premiere chef, it's up to you to seek out the finest ingredients from alien planets, cook delicious dishes, and serve them to customers in the comfort of your fully-customisable space trailer.\n\nExplore Alien Worlds\nThere's a whole universe of ingredients out there... if they don't eat you first. Explore distant planets, derelict space stations, and your own basement for plants, critters, and other tasty morsels.\n\nAlong the way, you'll come across space pirates, ancient ruins, and a suspiciously high number of recently abandoned restaurants. Keep an eye out for rare resources (and bits of random junk) that you can use to upgrade your gear, kitchen equipment, and spaceship.\n\nCook Up Cosmic Creations\nOnce your fridge is stocked with ingredients that have (mostly) stopped wriggling, it's time to flip the sign and start serving!\n\nCraft over 140 different dishes, from simple homestyle Beefle Skewers to the legendarily tricky Octoegg Surprise. Wow your customers with delicious food and speedy service, and you\u2019ll earn the Astronomical Culinary Excellence Stars that mark your path to intergalactic culinary success.\n\nAs your reputation grows, the customers start coming to you! Keep it flexible by continuing your delivery service or open up a sit-in restaurant with a constant flow of patrons. You're free to close the kitchen whenever adventure calls.\n\nSet a Stellar Ambiance\nYour space-trailer might not look too sharp from the outside, but she's got it where it counts. Take complete control of your interior with freely placeable decorations and an in-depth coloring system to create the restaurant of your dreams. Add new floors, create themed zones, and fill it with the furniture and props you find on your travels!\u00a0\n\nServe the Nebula\nThe citizens of the Horseshoe Nebula are more than just hungry bellies (most of them, anyway). Get to know Zoe the scrap dealer, faded Space Ace Jack Bronzon, the definitely-not-alien barman Zlurka, and many more characters on your journey to interstellar culinary stardom. Unique recipes, side quests, and even romance awaits if you can satisfy your loyal customers.\n\nWith your new-found friends, you\u2019ll uncover the truth about your missing grandma and take on the might of Galactic Burger as they try to muscle in on your space-turf.\n\nSpace Chef features:\n- Over 140 delectable dishes to create from 100+ alien ingredients\n- 5 alien planets to explore, from the jungle-filled Lush to aquatic Bluegoonia\n- 180+ creatures and plants to hunt, harvest, and run away from\n- 100+ craftable items for your character, ship, and kitchen\n- 150+ furnishings and decorations to personalize your restaurant\n- Freedom to create your own menu, opening times, and service style \u2013 vegetarian and vegan included!\n- A zany cast of characters, including romanceable NPCs with their own favorite recipes and questlines\n- A thrilling story of adventure, betrayal, and mass-produced burgers","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/841efe2d524a5f55f4749013c17571cb735f833dad91726b1c745b157ce19df0.jpg","id":"0100E37023538000","intro":"Hunt, cook, and deliver cosmic cuisine to become the greatest chef in the nebula!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Space Chef","nsuId":70010000097068,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Kwalee","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Mild Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251028,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9ee830e98d21837c3eaea4c5bab3c8d223a6f5bf6e87cfcb182d61536874f27b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/77888611160afa1dcd5254638b852bc12a7eb03653d356e167f77d92ff89c16f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b8c568ac6125680cfd175636582a0eaab04f8ebd7f6e7e91f17472db9bbde1c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9a9629b7aa196ebc08dbbe721453f34cad2138832eeb12b8afeb473a32b678f8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e27281fa76a383eaa1339468510798d2c592c09095afe9b24b7fc5f84ad3be1c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e6de314305aed4aa10996701f01312d4652e5f6d4fa23ab142a8a023175cd98e.jpg"],"size":1153433600,"version":null},"70010000101980":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/679209ba50bbd81f626794cd50ba76d41d5dc2f0cc76ba7632a99997d3f20f67.jpg","category":["Racing","Simulation","Arcade","Training"],"description":"Step into the role of a modern farmer and experience the rewarding life of agriculture.

Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance\u2014as she speaks with the devil himself.\n\nIndika\u2019s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery.
