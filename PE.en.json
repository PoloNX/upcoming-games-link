Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they\u2019re the Freelance Police\u2014an irreverent comedy duo whose esoteric crime-fighting style has been entertaining comic book and video game fans for more than thirty five years. \n\nIn 2006\u20132010, Sam & Max starred in a series of episodic adventures created by Telltale Games. Now you can play their first three seasons (Sixteen episodes altogether!) in these remastered versions, which have been lovingly updated with gorgeous HD graphics, overhauled lighting and lip-sync, finessed cinematography, remastered audio, and several all-new musical tracks featuring live jazz musicians. \n\nSAM & MAX SAVE THE WORLD\nIt's just another day at the office when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! \n\nWhat starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam & Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \"spinny thing\" they do with their eyes.) \n\nWho's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. \n\nSAM & MAX: BEYOND TIME AND SPACE\nThe Freelance Police are back on the crime beat in a showdown with Santa Claus, a race to subdue a giant volcano, and a face-off with a Eurotrash vampire\u2026 and then things get even weirder.\n\nIs paranoid shopkeeper Bosco on to something with his talk of a grand conspiracy? Is diner proprietress Stinky hiding the truth about what happened to her grandfather (also named Stinky)? Will flaky neighbor Sybil Pandemik ever find true love? Did someone say\u2026 BIRTHDAY?!\n\nZombies will dance. Mariachis will sing. A giant battle robot will trash the streets. And when their friends\u2019 lives are on the line, Sam & Max will risk their very souls to set things right. \n\nSAM & MAX: THE DEVIL\u2019S PLAYHOUSE\nMax has always been the more unhinged member of the Freelance Police\u2014a lovable lunatic with a knack for spreading chaos wherever he goes. But recently his abilities have taken a supernatural turn.\n\nIt all started when he stumbled upon a mysterious toy that allows him to glimpse the future. Now Sam & Max have aroused the attention of a host of villains from across the galaxy who are hellbent on acquiring the magical Toys of Power to achieve their own ends.\n\nAs those who seek the Devil\u2019s Toybox close in and Max\u2019s psychic abilities grow beyond his control, the Freelance Police will come up against their most frightening adversary yet: the power of Max\u2019s mind.\n\n\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"What's better than one Sam & Max season?

Experiment with it to unlock its full potential.\nThis is a game with true star power!\n\nA Legendary Soundtrack\nThe composer David Wise hardly needs any introduction. In his work on the Gimmick! 2 soundtrack, he has both written completely new melodies and remade old classics. The soundtrack was creatively directed by Pelle Cahndlerby and recorded live in Sweden together with Joel Bille.\n\nBlast from the past\nThe original Gimmick! game was released for the Famicom\u2122 in 1992. It was localized and released in the West - but only in Scandinavia. This, combined with the fact that the game's physics and gameplay mechanics were far ahead of its time, made the game both fabled and beloved. With Gimmick! 2, however, there is no longer any doubt: this is a game that the whole world should have the chance to experience.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8c5c0288cc33c6e2677b31411bf109a9deaed9bcc354e58e72eb0b81afc83f62.jpg","id":"0100DC301F3F8000","intro":"Yumetaro is back!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it","zh","zh"],"name":"Gimmick! 2","nsuId":70010000081723,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Clear River Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Mild Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240905,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07b8274557de40f5b290279ddc7e0059c32380c482604182c1c860173bb7a62c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b97bb9ca4ff84c5b824689d0c34e659f67cf650ef2c7626025270e14b2fb3b9a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9d9af0bcb81970ceafffc946a8d8462f55b399227798671290758ccf1f29d527.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/815d1578ee0cc3b967e0be25cdbb56134c8f0fe031910bd9e331c54eeba920ef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/56901e0b04c207819352194e281a83eace2855774c717a01c7a33eb591d5ce7f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/91904fdd010913b7cda9f7aa9d99b5ef965568ee99527cb7217396db12056b20.jpg"],"size":1627389952,"version":null},"70010000083903":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d551b2dee1b267f36000ce3ae52b20001cb26dc0fa0609a89defd7896e38ab66.jpg","category":["Sports","Training"],"description":"Partner up with Hatsune Miku, and duck, jab, and punch your way to fitness in the classic Fitness Boxing Mode, or in the brand new \"Miku Exercise\" mode featuring original songs from your favorite Piapro Characters!

With a mix of classic arcade and console mechanics, players will battle against mutated victims and machines, dodge bullet barrages, and crush bosses in nine levels of gore-ific brutality. As Vadim, fight back against The Meat and stop the terrors spawned from scientist Yuri Markov's experiments on the Moon.\n\nMULTI-PHASE BOSS FIGHTS\nIron Meat pays homage to classic run-and-gun titles from the past, with intense boss fights fixed into multiple phases. With three difficulty settings to choose from, players can put their skills to the test, where a higher difficulty is rewarded with an even more challenging boss battle.\n\nMULTIPLAYER COUCH CO-OP\nWho says you have to take on The Meat invasion alone? With 2-player couch co-op, you can grab a buddy to leave a trail of bloody, Meat-infected corpses together! It's double the firepower, double the carnage, and double the MEAT!\n\nOVER 30 UNLOCKABLE SKINS\nYou don't have to be a soldier to fight against The Meat. Hell, you don't even have to be a HUMAN to do so! With over 30 unlockable skins to choose from, players can customize their character the way they want. Each skin comes with interchangeable parts, allowing for greater customization with mixing and matching. Want a shark head on a robot body with dinosaur feet? DONE. Maybe a half human, half doggo? YOU BET! Or how about a cowboy with a tail and demon wings?

Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics.
