Together, players venture out into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat.  During combat, there is no set player turn order, so your strategy can adapt at a moment's notice to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to co-operatively find the best path to success. \n\nBetween missions, players return to Arden and help improve their home village. Unlock and upgrade different local vendors, build relationships with other Sunderfolk to earn rewards, and outfit characters with new Skills, Weapons, Trinkets, and more.\n\nAs heroes of Arden, protect the town and its Brightshard from the corruption of shadowstone and defeat threats from the surrounding Sunderlands. \n\nCouch Co-Op First\nThe best adventures are meant to be shared. Up to four players can play together in this new tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. \n\nStep into a New World \nScan a QR code on the display, download the free Sunderfolk phone app*, and transform your phone or tablet into a controller, hand of cards, rule book, inventory, and more. All friends and family can learn to play quickly, since all they need will be in-hand. \n\nSix Unique Heroes \nTraditional RPG classes have been reimagined in Sunderfolk.

Power up with Trinkets and Weapons to craft your character\u2019s build  quest-to-quest. \n\nTactical Combat Inspired by the Tabletop\nEach player takes their turn one at a time by choosing one of their Skill Cards to determine their character's actions. Enemies lurk around every corner, each with their own abilities and strategies, and they will challenge your party to change its approach from one encounter to the next.\n\nRebuild the Village of Arden \nThe village of Arden grew around the remnant of a magical substance known as brightstone, but unknown forces from lands outside have started to threaten this community's very existence. Between quests, return to Arden village to upgrade vendors, acquire new items and equipment, and befriend townsfolk for additional rewards. \n\nFour Players, One Game\nShare the experience of Sunderfolk with friends at no extra cost.

Her name was Addie Baker, and strangely enough, she is not the first to disappear in Looninville. For Lesley Jacobson, now a private phenomenon investigator, Addie Baker was her best friend and neighbor growing up. Twenty-eight-years later, Lesley is still haunted by the night Addie disappeared, as she was the only one to witness it, or was she?\n\nDeciding to combine her personal and professional life, Lesley returns to Looninville to close the mystery and move forward in life with her daughter. Lacking to find any concrete evidence or input from the skittish locals, Lesley returns to the one place that appears to be at the center of these strange occurrences, a cave. The uneasy problem with this, is that Lesley does not remember there ever being a cave at all.\n\nCave of Illusions is a psychological, atmospheric horror game that will have you questioning every step taken as the reality around you will begin to shift. Things are not always as they seem, even when witnessed with the naked eye, and one must pursue the constant battle of the mind with remembering what you think you know and understanding what you actually know.

After the unsuccessful use, the irrepressible book returns to its author from the other world, uncontrollably summoning horrifying monsters. The only salvation is to stop the book and prevent evil forces from taking over the world.\nBosorka is an exciting action game that combines the best elements of the roguelike and shoot'em up genres with incredibly stylized top-down 3D visualization. Immerse yourself in this dark fantasy world and show the demons who's the power to be reckoned with.\n\nExciting journeys to various locations!\nSeveral huge levels are generated from manually created parts. Each level is an independent biome with its own unique atmosphere, mysteries and dangerous creatures. Secret rooms, hidden passages, breathtaking landscapes, and lots of valuable things that can be encountered in unexpected places provide a real incentive to explore the environment.\n\nBosses from the netherworld!\nAt the end of each level, you will meet powerful monsters that guard the passages to the next locations, preventing you from following the book. Each monster has an exceptional set of uncanny abilities and is capable of incinerating you in an instant, so one should be well prepared for this encounter.\n\nCompanion Demons!\nIn the midst of a circle of evil demons, there may be renegades who have not been affected by evil spells and have no bad intentions. Lovely creatures, surprisingly loyal to those who save them. Raise an entire army of companions who will help you in the fight against the enemy. Some of them have marvelous abilities that will definitely come in handy.\n\nCaution! Dangerous Spells!\nDestroy enemy hordes of evil creatures by means of powerful spells. Burn, freeze, strike with incredible lightning bolts, or pelt everyone with slimy frogs \u2014 there're various spells to suit every taste. Mysterious mirrors hidden in different corners of these regions will reveal to you new spells to defend this world from. Find them and develop the tactics to wipe out the evil.\n\nAmazing combinations of collected items!\nStrong health, protective shell, poisonous touch or a deadly whirlwind around you, and perhaps even more. Make your own unique collection of runes. Each rune performs only one function, but the combination of several of them can significantly change the entire gameplay, turning you into a real natural calamity. And now, who is hunting who?\n\nExciting flight on a broomstick!\nAn enchanted witch's broom is not only a means of transportation. Each broom has its own specialty and is capable of a great deal more than just flying.
