Branching Roads, Branching Plot\nWhen you reach a branching road, that means that the plot is going to branch as well.\nThe story will move forward in different ways depending on whether you keep going straight or take a turn. You can also turn around and go check out a road you didn't choose before but the more you travel, the more the girls' \"fullness\" will decrease.\n\n3. Gathering and Cooking\nOn the road, you'll find ingredients that you can cook with.\nBy eating what you cook, you can increase the girls' fullness and other parameters.\nThere are some branches in the road that you can only access if the girls' parameters have reached a certain level too.

In each level, you\u2019ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don\u2019t jump while the eye\u2019s watching, or you\u2019ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you\u2019ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter\u2019s kaleidoscopic visualizer.\n\nDon\u2019t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.\n\nAt its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made. A cacophony of colors dazzle your eyes as the music gradually builds up based on your progress. If you want to take a break from the arcade action, jump into the ungame, where you can channel your inner Jeff Minter and play around with all the sights and sounds from the game.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 55 levels with a variety of challenges to conquer in each\n- Unique tube-shooter bonus stages between each level\n- Llamasoft's unique brand of mind melting visuals\n- Procedural music that builds as you rack up a high score\n- Earn your bragging rights in the online leaderboards\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c0dde56763322bf0b593c9fd7312e66df7b64adf166ab6b6e5fcc4711031fc5b.jpg","id":"010086901F822000","intro":"Jeff Minter is back with another unique take on a 1980s Atari arcade game.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es","fr","de","it"],"name":"I, Robot","nsuId":70010000082764,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Atari","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Mild Fantasy Violence","Mild Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250417,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a59ac3a782e9cda7ae33d1ab927c61dab720ac630aee66573cf985551bb4b45f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e8f74cf87b4e59b8b920b26c3a4a14d73a16f20fa4f2033301f71d63007033b4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8108455b5b392e35434130f29b1fda548a3dc203090eaf483ce63cf9b4f80dbb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d315becddf4ad73c2dea33bb92b58da9e18c25eddab1cc389f93f647edf7e89a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/520fbccad8912fb9159c22a7849c48563c7abbcc551443d39547dacbd0f00c7a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5a91051eac5d63cbf78ae3531cb995e2c4507123ddf103a7d91744130880b6a7.jpg"],"size":208666624,"version":null},"70010000083270":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2bc8aa01e7447b7ec95401a036b45942820a6596d8084fdd7ea0ad44e29f04b6.jpg","category":["Strategy","Board Game","Puzzle"],"description":"Chessarama is a collection of original puzzle and strategy games inspired by Chess.

A thousand years ago, humanity lived on the now volcanic and lifeless earth-like planet known as Terra. Due to the planetary catastrophe, ASTRA, humans were forced to find a new home.

Centuries later in the year 30XX, Luna became home to some of the most brilliant human minds in existence (and their creations). However, humanity's existence is now threatened by an oncoming antimatter comet - the same comet that wiped out the people of Terra a thousand years ago!\n\nJoin Lunar Warrior Bella as she fights her way across the Moon to find a way to destroy the comet before it wipes out life as we know it!

Together, players venture out into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat.  During combat, there is no set player turn order, so your strategy can adapt at a moment's notice to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to co-operatively find the best path to success. \n\nBetween missions, players return to Arden and help improve their home village. Unlock and upgrade different local vendors, build relationships with other Sunderfolk to earn rewards, and outfit characters with new Skills, Weapons, Trinkets, and more.\n\nAs heroes of Arden, protect the town and its Brightshard from the corruption of shadowstone and defeat threats from the surrounding Sunderlands. \n\nCouch Co-Op First\nThe best adventures are meant to be shared. Up to four players can play together in this new tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. \n\nStep into a New World \nScan a QR code on the display, download the free Sunderfolk phone app*, and transform your phone or tablet into a controller, hand of cards, rule book, inventory, and more. All friends and family can learn to play quickly, since all they need will be in-hand. \n\nSix Unique Heroes \nTraditional RPG classes have been reimagined in Sunderfolk. Take up the mantle of an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger or Rogue \u2013 each with their own playstyle. Tailor your character\u2019s strengths with Skill Cards. Power up with Trinkets and Weapons to craft your character\u2019s build  quest-to-quest. \n\nTactical Combat Inspired by the Tabletop\nEach player takes their turn one at a time by choosing one of their Skill Cards to determine their character's actions. Enemies lurk around every corner, each with their own abilities and strategies, and they will challenge your party to change its approach from one encounter to the next.\n\nRebuild the Village of Arden \nThe village of Arden grew around the remnant of a magical substance known as brightstone, but unknown forces from lands outside have started to threaten this community's very existence. Between quests, return to Arden village to upgrade vendors, acquire new items and equipment, and befriend townsfolk for additional rewards. \n\nFour Players, One Game\nShare the experience of Sunderfolk with friends at no extra cost.

Her name was Addie Baker, and strangely enough, she is not the first to disappear in Looninville. For Lesley Jacobson, now a private phenomenon investigator, Addie Baker was her best friend and neighbor growing up. Twenty-eight-years later, Lesley is still haunted by the night Addie disappeared, as she was the only one to witness it, or was she?\n\nDeciding to combine her personal and professional life, Lesley returns to Looninville to close the mystery and move forward in life with her daughter. Lacking to find any concrete evidence or input from the skittish locals, Lesley returns to the one place that appears to be at the center of these strange occurrences, a cave. The uneasy problem with this, is that Lesley does not remember there ever being a cave at all.\n\nCave of Illusions is a psychological, atmospheric horror game that will have you questioning every step taken as the reality around you will begin to shift. Things are not always as they seem, even when witnessed with the naked eye, and one must pursue the constant battle of the mind with remembering what you think you know and understanding what you actually know.
