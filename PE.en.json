Solve nonogram grids to unveil the great canvases of the history of painting around the world remade by the Kubits, these little chameleon squares who glue themselves to grids to make new images.\n\nKubits Gallery is a logic game for casual players where you can solve different logic puzzles on grids to create images. You can take all the time you need and relax while you solve more than 120 levels of nonogram spread across fictional galleries representing the history of painting in 3 countries.\n\nNonograms are a bit like crosswords but for pictures, a solo puzzle game where you paint on a grid by blackening the grid cells with Kubits (squares). To achieve this you will have to use the clues located around the grid. These numbers tell you the groups of black squares in a row or a column and the size of the groups. Try this famous game played since long ago but with a modern and colorful twist, telling the story of more than 2000 years of pictorial arts.\n\n- More than 120 levels of nonogram with various difficulties\n- A journey through the history of painting, from the prehistoric times to ours\n- Fictional galleries from 3 different countries to visit\n- Accessibility features to make playing more enjoyable like undoing your moves or 3 difficulty levels\n- A modern interface, colorful and dynamic ","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/77f12d02d3a8e9bd57bb869cf3866645c03d43bfcf9400e5408d4232d1a2ee98.jpg","id":"0100D5701E874000","intro":"Solve nonogram grids to repaint the vanished paintings inside museums around the world in more than 120 levels in various fictional galleries!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","fr"],"name":"Kubits Gallery","nsuId":70010000078901,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"TyGAMES","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240708,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3e529544e4ba2dd32e0424f909aebb5686adec0219ea7ad2790c490df08a7942.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c04ed61ddb59022977de2c4e997c97d59379210f67de376765234f52d209e94.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8164ccfda16306f8f3d854ac876a8bd33350a6de358e621031a4863ea5cdc55.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9f4e22410bd53b0cd7eb27f546f00bd5fb5c701a9da756e0afa2c16edc64d8c8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/10396abd829eae36617d2f1e33510a0261b92d0bbb63bbf0d1e85af843ccc3e9.jpg"],"size":208666624,"version":null},"70010000084152":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a10a7072858445db8b2a78319bb9d846f11c1877eece4e46ff550a3a43d881e0.jpg","category":["Arcade","Adventure","Platformer","Other"],"description":"Emotional Journey: \nTraverse a beautifully crafted 3D environment as you guide the fox through a heartfelt narrative.

Peach Boy) and his allies, Kintaro and Issuntaro, wiped out the tribe of ogres who plagued the Japanese countryside, and everyone lived happily every after.\n\n...Until now, anyway.\n\nCenturies later, Momotaro's descendant -- bored of life as a bar host (!) -- decides to run amok and terrorize the Japanese countryside with mononoke and yokai and all those other Japanese mysticism-related things you've probably heard the tiniest bit about from some anime somewhere. Not because it's his destiny or anything; just because he CAN.\n\nWith the hero now serving as villain, it's time to flip the script and turn the villains into heroes!

There ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We\u2019ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend?\n\nGET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS\nWhat\u2019s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you\u2019d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. \n\nRUN YOUR BASE SMART...

You\u2019ll be managing workers who\u2019ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you\u2019ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work.\n\nTAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS\nIn our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner.

From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. \nHow the story will end depends purely on you - there\u2019ll be a pesky agent who\u2019ll want to work with you, and there\u2019ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You\u2019re a free man, after all. \n\nThat\u2019s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies.

This year marks 30 years since the original release of \u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d (PC-9801 ed.) in 1993. In this title, the graphics were newly redrawn by Takami Akai, who directed production and worked on character design for the original \u201cPrincess Maker\u201d series at Gainax.\n\nAbout \u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d\n\u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d is a childrearing simulation game in which the player experiences being the father to a daughter granted to them by the stars.\nThey raise the girl for eight years, from ages ten to eighteen. Your daughter grows up to be an adult through various experiences in the game. The girl\u2019s dream is to become a princess, but a wide variety of opportunities await depending on how you raise her. What kind of dream will you make come true for this girl?\n\nRedrawing the graphics\nThis title is based on \u201cPrincess Maker 2: Refine,\u201d released in 2004. Especially important graphics were redrawn by Takami Akai in a style similar to the PC-98 version. The graphics are drawn in high resolution befitting modern game systems, with a commitment to quality in the details.\n\nAddition of an opening animation\nAn opening animation by Yonago Gainax has been added to the game. The animation, drawn by a team led by Takami Akai, envisions the future the player will have as the \u201cfather\u201d with their \u201cdaughter\u201d.\n\nKnowing how your daughter is doing is the first step in raising her\nThis title is a social simulation, so it is very important to always be aware of your daughter's status and use this to raise her.\nIn \u201cRegeneration\u201d, parameters for assessing your daughter's status are always available, so you can check on her at a glance. Check what you should do for your daughter\u2019s future, and raise her carefully.\n\nMessage from Takami Akai\nI am deeply grateful to see that \u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d, which came out 30 years ago, is still so beloved by so many fans that we can release a new version. This time I was finally able to redo the graphics, which I had always wanted to do. Please enjoy the newly redrawn vacations and endings.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b147ba5e132e67b6665c6859b3c12d2f22812ae5cf35dc3dbd9af2436dfad3e6.jpg","id":"0100D4F01ABF2000","intro":"Dad, it's time to start our journey together!

Perhaps he can use his knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. If he can change history, then maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 he\u2019ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn\u2019t Sumika here?

She calls herself Meiya, and insists that the two of them are destined for one another. This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood friend Sumika, who\u2019s always had feelings for him, and who realizes that if she doesn\u2019t act fast, she might lose him forever. But just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for Sumika run deeper than he thought? In the end, he\u2019ll need to decide between the girl who\u2019s been with him through thick and thin, or the stranger who claims they\u2019re bound together by fate.\n\n\u2014Muv-Luv Alternative\u2014\nThree years have passed since Takeru awoke in a world not his own \u2014 a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was locked in a struggle against the BETA. In that time, he\u2019s been through a lot \u2014 enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to him, he was being trained as part of a secret plan known as Alternative IV \u2014 a last-ditch effort to take back Earth. Unfortunately, the project hit a wall in its research, and was scrapped in favor of its successor: Alternative V. A select few would abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru is one of the ones left behind, and dies in a hopeless war against the BETA.\nBut fate has plans for Takeru, because he wakes up to find himself back in his bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you \u2014 but back where he was three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But this is also a second chance. Perhaps he can use his knowledge to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. If he can change history, then maybe he\u2019ll find answers to his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn\u2019t Sumika here?

Aside from the usual responsibilities of a headmaster, you are also tasked with managing various issues that originate outside the school, including mysterious dangers and potential threats that might cause things to go bananas!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1375ca4ed00529dbb937f9162d7306ee00eadd3f381c69f9d62caa75196d5344.jpg","id":"0100F4C01EBC6000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","fr","de","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Let's School","nsuId":70010000079865,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PM Studios","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240716,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5f28f3da111201f968fa7968f346fb314254bdc73eabfeeba951fcef8c0a078f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9c9b6d1b9246720a06bbe0c7ccd1bbfa5ec298587694ef7ef114ea06f9524285.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bcaba30f0fcdc72de2393e5084b70ab15cf49379caea539b075451b25950cac2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fa9e2f42e51e6b71f08db299037cfc7da1230cb20e0277f3d716f673e3caefdf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1d31f72b234f6c07984521f4cd55a21e2c2edc3a6ae31d3598c4da48bfe3ae4a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6bf2409bb4fc84f80a3c7f6f40a50f09985d5b450b85f2fa64cc34781b814757.jpg"],"size":487587840,"version":null},"70010000079899":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c3b7b253d7b305f65d3801f07bcbf429ec68eff9b4548787bdbf5afe4780f4ec.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure"],"description":"You will play the role of a heroic spirit resurrected from the dead, accept the entrustment of the God of Chaos, and once again enter the terrifying abyss that has long been occupied by demons and monsters!\n\nExtremely smooth mowing experience\nIn the abyss, you will face thousands of abominable monsters simultaneously, and they are endless and seemingly endless!

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar.

Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
