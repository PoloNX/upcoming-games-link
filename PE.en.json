Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati\u2019s army on each specific Battlefield.\n\nA SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN\nUncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more.

Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!\n\nWith a highly customisable class system, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging loot that truly changes the way you play: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.\n\nKeeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat. After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each procedurally generated adventure. If you\u2019re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with 6 different difficulty levels \u2013 or pick Hardcore Mode with permadeath, where every battle can be the last!\n\nAlso features Roguelike Mode, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!\n\nCarve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield.

A lone island, sitting in the middle of an endless ocean, and the site of a magical phenomenon known only as the Rift. It was once a source of limitless power for humanity, through magical creatures called the Ateyan. Capable of incredible and wonderful feats of magic, they lived alongside humanity for centuries - until something destroyed this harmony. The Ateyan disappeared, becoming motes of light on an almost deserted island. Human civilizations crumbled, its formerly great cities and industry reclaimed by nature. Generations passed in the shadow of ancient splendor. Then, something happened: The Rift began consuming the island, threatening the survival of humanity's remnants.\n\nMonster Tribe puts you in the shoes of humanity's last hope, a sage born with a natural connection to the Ateyan, capable of calling them forth from the void between the real world and the Rift.

Can the rift be stopped?\n\nCan a single human make a difference?\n\nIsland of Akama\n\nThe vast island has a long and terrible history.

In addition, attachments such as mulching kits, stripe rollers, recyclers, grass collectors, and flail decks contribute further to the high degree of realism. So choose between Career Mode, Free Mode, and Challenge Mode and tackle a variety of contracts giving you a realistic lawn mowing experience. \n\nREAL-WORLD LICENSED MOWER BRANDS\nThe original licensed lawn mower brands of Toro, SCAG, STIGA, and EGO have been re-created in a visually and physically stunning way. Select from a dozen mowers, each presenting unique challenges, attachments, and upgrades for an immersive and realistic experience.\n\nACCURATE AND ATTENTIVE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT\nBuild your own lawncare business from the ground up. Purchase and upgrade your headquarters, hire employees, purchase advertising, and balance the books as you grow and expand your business.\n\nQUICK MOW MODE FOR THOSE WHO CAN\u2019T WAIT\nIf you feel like getting to work without going through any menus or the prerequisites of certain campaigns, the Quick Mow Mode is exactly what you need. Choose this option to start mowing immediately on a randomly picked map with a combination of character and lawn mower chosen for you by the system.

Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you\u2019ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time!\n\nNEW STORY-ORIENTED MISSIONS\nA holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of engaging new story-oriented missions at varying difficulty levels, as you build strength to confront Rockwell in a final battle for the ages. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover Explorer Notes and environmental cues along the way to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga.\n\nEXPANSIVE WORLDS TO CONQUER\nIn ARK: Genesis 2, you\u2019ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor. Your skills, your tames, your weapons and your builds -- everything that you\u2019ve accomplished is put to the test here, as the future of humanity hangs in the balance!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Emerge into a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in extensive story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"ARK: Genesis Part 2","nsuId":70050000036384,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Snail Games USA","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Blood","Crude Humor","Use of Alcohol","Violence","Users Interact"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240530,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000040082":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8c57465cee620457eaa1fafbbc2d32013c51662b1a343b4d2cf3f29d4cfc9512.jpg","category":null,"description":"Experience more from LEGO 2K Drive with the Season 4 Drive Pass.\n\nBonus content is only accessible by the Nintendo Account used for purchasing this content.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Season 4 Drive Pass","nsuId":70050000040082,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"2K","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence","Users Interact","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240531,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000045562":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/059739576097255ae97843d3899387963cdf1894d8af3c73631bc511f190c606.jpg","category":null,"description":"Clue - Millionaire Forest Retreat includes a Location, 6 Suspects, 4 Customisation Items, and 6 Tokens to unlock!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Clue - Millionaire Forest Retreat","nsuId":70050000045562,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Marmalade Game Studio","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Mild Violence","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240617,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000042874":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2923f71643f5032d2b5786cc3fd896e3eb1d168b4a64ecc84ef0422295f73dee.jpg","category":null,"description":"Even more emotions await you in the HOT WHEELS UNLEASHED\u2122 2 - Mercedes-Benz Pack!
