One crystal sustained the spirit world, and the other enhanced the material one. This continued until one of the traitors stole and claimed control over the sources of these energies. He desired to become a God and subjugate the entire world. At great cost, the precursors managed to reclaim the crystals of divine power. They shattered both crystals into numerous fragments. Now, the world is protected from the traitors but vulnerable to external threats. Under the reliable protection of ancient mages, the shards are hidden in four parts of the world, and the knowledge about them is carefully guarded by keepers of knowledge. Much time has passed since then... People have forgotten about the crystals of divine power. However, sensing the defenseless planet, universal evil began to infiltrate this world. Descendants of the keepers of knowledge, upon witnessing the turmoil, started gathering the crystal fragments. Time is running out.\n\nIn this game, you will become a keeper of knowledge, collecting shards of divine crystals. Look for the right way to crystals. Avoid dangerous obstacles. Teleport from one space to another to get closer to your goal. Solve tasks on memory, logic and orientation in space to get to the blocked areas.

Some just require a few upgrades here and there. Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you!\nDid we mention wildfires?\n\nTrackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way.\n\nThe game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists.\n\nGATHER RESOURCES\nThere aren't many resources in the desert, so you\u2019ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way.\n\nUNLOCK BLUEPRINTS\nYou\u2019ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, it\u2019s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely.\n\nBUILD\nWith enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key.\n\nDEFEND\nAttacks are frequent. You\u2019ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, you\u2019ll have to be more creative with how you use them.\n\nKEEP THE TRAIN GOING\nFeed your train with fuel, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything. Try to automate things to keep moving as the game gets harder and harder with time and distance.\n\nFEATURES\n- High replayability value\n- Many items to gather and craft\n- Multiple game modes\n- Mini quests to complete\n- Random deterministic map generator","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8a14f6a207f6d8acbb157c58be888701450234566f216dad3053b97e3870ab59.jpg","id":"0100AD801E6F8000","intro":"Embark on a thrilling journey through an unforgiving desert.
