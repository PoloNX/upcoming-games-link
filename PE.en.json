Across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d of anime-inspired adventure, Ringo and Wolfe will have to work together to find answers, make up for past mistakes, and travel across the universe in search of their goal. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll learn how to get along at some point!\n\nTrained in the ways of Kiai, a magical form of martial art and also the universe\u2019s most exciting form of televised entertainment, Ringo can combine words to create customized attacks in intense turn-based battles. Defeat or befriend a cast of fearsome space pirates, mysterious scoundrels, cute witches, high school delinquents, talking crows, and skilled martial artists on your way to becoming a Kiai master.\n\nUSE YOUR WORDS\nCreate custom attacks by combining words up to the limit of your spirit level. The more spirit you have, the more slots you have to place words into and the more powerful and complex actions you can take.\n\nAll words have cool downs and opponents might be weak or strong against specific attacks or specific elements. You won\u2019t know which until you engage them in battle so you need to be prepared to improvise.\n\nCOLLECT THEM ALL\nWith over 200 words to collect across the game there is a near infinite number of possible unique attacks to make. As you expand Ringo\u2019s vocabulary you\u2019ll need to carefully select which words you take into battle, building strategies around your mix of categories, blend of offensive and defensive words, giving yourself options to manage your opponents weaknesses and strengths, consider optimizing the juggling of cool downs and, of course, which attacks sound the coolest.\n\nThe result is an accessible, immediately fun but deep combat system.\n\nSTEP UP WITH PEP UPS\nThe core ethos of the Kiai martial art is to fight with honor. Defeating an opponent with honor can turn the most heated of rivals into the fastest of friends! Befriend your rivals to earn their words of encouragement in the form of useful Pep Ups which can be equipped to give you special bonuses in combat.\n\nTHE STARS CALL\nTravel the universe on a rollercoaster adventure as you seek the pieces of the Wanderstar map, Ringo\u2019s lost brother and the answers to Wolfe\u2019s mysterious past.\n\nUNLIKELY ALLIES\nAlong the way you\u2019ll build a found family of colorful characters, each with their own thing going on. They might not all get along at first, but that\u2019s nothing a thrilling space adventure can\u2019t fix! And even with the trail gone cold, take heart, for these wandering stars are bound to find each other...\n\nAN ANIME YOU CAN PLAY\nInspired by anime the developers grew up watching, Wander Stars plays out across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d, each one taking between 60-90 minutes to complete. Each episode features a map to explore with procedurally generated battles, special events and other secrets to find along with the main story events.\n\nPlay an episode at a time, or binge the whole thing in one go! You can even replay episodes to find all the side adventures, NPCs, and party member banter you might have missed! Try new paths as you explore ever-changing maps with randomized special events, lurking rivals, and tantalizing treasures.

Seizing this opportunity, a young woman and a young man, having come of age after being driven from Hallfein long ago, now return to the land they once called home.\n\nAfter meeting in their hometown, the two embark on a journey together to seek the truth, unaware of the encounters and revelations that await them...\n\nField:\nThis adventure is set on the Lantarna mainland.

Up to three party members can be placed on both the front and back rows. Utilize new elements such as Multi-Actions, Item Mix, and Unite Attacks to add even more excitement to battles!\n\nSynthesis:\nCreate items through \"Gift Color Synthesis\" by linking the Gift Colors of ingredients.

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era. This feature allows players to learn about Yoshiwara, even aspects that many Japanese people are unfamiliar with. Additionally, the game supports English and Simplified Chinese, enabling players from different language regions to explore and learn about Japan\u2019s Edo period.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/18b8e1558f9af283c908914584dac0fdc624ad2c8db8b26b2fd9361e8a4d9b8d.jpg","id":"0100D14021E4A000","intro":"A Time loop mystery set in Japan\u2019s Edo period!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh"],"name":"GHOST TRAVELER: Adventures in Edo","nsuId":70010000097776,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"SUCCESS","rating":17,"ratingContent":["Blood","Intense Violence","Partial Nudity","Sexual Themes","Strong Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251016,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de6f4dad0480e5705c8f3e93d1ba0fe377afb688f91259cbc8a3fa63e068ca9e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/25e88f73150091b2b86dc3c6d9164075a149de6e1780865ce5e049a5ad95db1a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2d4203bd9d7fba4f2582a2457337e34059c0c19ae063e84038ab74c944024c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a890c1da6f7356a724f82461bc79ee808bcea193a035dafd4c2a2e3e34762f10.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a21b5fd243cd30eda0f2a9c3604965876bed8bcf2ea5906eee0733db58a1d66c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1ae2395cbd2852e932e3116e0d0e49e26c2392054dba66863566a1fba2567344.jpg"],"size":2091909120,"version":null},"70010000099365":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/870d2482d0369ab35e5615e585b8908c0365f1901d0ac39be73c5e922ad4b4ec.jpg","category":["RPG","Action"],"description":"Lumiose City\u2014a home for people and Pok\u00e9mon alike.

So much so that I completely forgot I'd even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.\nNow that things have finally settled down, I\u2014Yuri Mito\u2014am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.\n\nJust as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.\n\nThis is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.\nThe Tayutama Fan Disc brings you the lovey-dovey days of a couple in love!\n\n\nMain Characters\n\u25cf Mashiro Mito, VA: Risa Matsuda\nUpon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call \"\"intense\"\", and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she's not exactly human...\nMashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that's just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.\n\n\u25cf Ameri Kawai, VA: Kaori Hanano\nThe childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She's a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro. \nShe can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she's a bit on the timid side...\n\n\u25cf Mifuyu Kisaragi, VA: Rina Misaki\nShe is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls' Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She's well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn't mean she isn't without her flaws.\nShe's rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man...\n\n\u25cf Yumina Takanashi, VA: Yu Aoto\nYumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise. Unfortunately, Mari Mito, the family matron, passes away long before the start of our story, and Yumina is ultimately adopted to the Takanashi family out of concern of a lack of mother figure.\nShe's one of those people who immediately fails at a task whenever someone is watching out of nervousness. But she doesn't mind working hard, and she's actually rather good at handling the household chores. She tends to get lost in her own imagination. \n\n\u25cf Nue, VA: Mika\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nShe transformed into a human-like form over 500 years ago, but due to some unknown incident, lost her memory and has remained that way ever since.\nAfter Mifuyu offered to become her guardian, she quickly grew attached and now brings a cheerful, innocent energy that puts everyone at ease.\n\n\u25cf Ouryu, VA: Taiyo Sorano\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nOnce thought to see humans as nothing more than prey, it turns out the truth is quite the opposite\u2014he simply envisioned a different kind of coexistence from Mashiro.\nThough he usually hides in the pond in the Kawai family\u2019s garden, he often takes human form to walk among people.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0934a67c1194fd5500aa7e387f2d23aad5f551c7de86168d1756dcfc1bdeb745.jpg","id":"0100A13022F30000","intro":"This is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh","zh"],"name":"Tayutama:It's happy days","nsuId":70010000095542,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Frontier Works","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Sexual Themes","Use of Alcohol"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251023,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/220f03a24f8768494a018765234f63ef2e74c1541fff80140ea7f9a9fa396299.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a710dd613e65e684d484c1a6ec883fbc89694a36f3fbeb01b433710395756425.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/72cb8f79cd774dfec75cf5dc0d6db16f1b0f678b21322ed0c1bc64375c06e139.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/63fc0f96b3db6ac51e2474385540ac9ce63c99ab78d99ebb405c52c8cf11477a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c56d96620dfe6ae3a3ebc479c1a092d1692030233b49036f4fb549d6fcd40857.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f9fca505631eb6d8f95bc5f9da34c96553b167c3559f3090df5c1a221ad921ef.jpg"],"size":4083154944,"version":null},"70010000098108":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/26f05300a3c43c196dc6ec85ea4c10c27373ed2a50998cb78d0142566add8fc0.jpg","category":["Sports","Adventure","Party","Multiplayer"],"description":"Welcome to Sports Camp, the ultimate party game packed with over 35 unique and unexpected\nactivities.

Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark?
