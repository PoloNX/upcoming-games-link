These toilet-like creatures immediately began attacking towns and villages, causing chaos and destruction.\n\nHumanity was not ready for such an invasion.

Created in a hand-drawn and collage art style reminiscent of cozy picture books, it presents a harbor populated with surprising creatures such as the scrapcrabs and the bobcat kittens, but also yummy \u201cmousemallows\u201d. \n\nThe SOLO adventure is suitable for young children on their own thanks to specific accessibility features. It doesn\u2019t require knowing how to read and can be played with a touch screen. With short gameplay stages that enable trial and error, Mouse & Crane befits different skill and experience levels.\nIn this mode, players control Crane\u2019s arm. They start with just a hook to transport things like containers or Mouse himself, and progressively discover various upgrades such as a giant magnet to grab metal scraps and tools, or a wrecking ball for the most satisfying demolitions!\n\nMouse & Crane also shines in CO-OP with the child and parent (or an older sibling) working creatively together to solve puzzles that can't be completed alone, sharing digital moments. In this mode, one player plays as Crane while the other can make Electryna move and jump with fun motion controls, helping Mouse get new tools... Electryna\u2019s swiftness and electric powers are a delight. \n\nThe game is produced by two studios from Denmark and Canada that are experienced in creating meaningful and wholesome experiences for children. Mouse & Crane shows the power of cooperation, creativity, upcycling and DIY crafting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/edebd27aec7891069ed63eea7d40cca030da96448656e9da56f491653a8c93a2.jpg","id":"010053B01F3F4000","intro":"Ideal as a child\u2019s first game, Mouse & Crane is a single or multiplayer adventure offering creative puzzle-solving moments through cooperation, upcycling and construction.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","fr"],"name":"Mouse & Crane","nsuId":70010000081605,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Those Eyes","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240621,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80313b5718caa9689f6784baa1e9939bde5d156405ebf5af158a53288f6a3eef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e71e9873c7c6bf6cf72a09ff0bcf89a1116625c3ce5fc402ee972030229608a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8ae08d6ff3261ac3b415fa359840e416a02d716617ed12adff48777bcb84b61b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2beae13defe99ee9ce700941dd2e72a750ab63c3534cc60c37c51d1463c5a0de.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/235fb000bb0be96019cd24cded7dcea3686b60d7fa155e98484970b7e565d717.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc99a435a31b4b8387c1a0021521935b3cfee1b513a6a405e9c4d80725ac044a.jpg"],"size":776994816,"version":null},"70010000081051":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/05a6c93a26ce7d33c8d0ab1281e4d15ea0ceb305090e4d4c8ce282ba38a86833.jpg","category":["Arcade","Action","Adventure","Simulation"],"description":"Control the hungry snake on the hunt for food to grow longer and bigger.

But this time, instead of blowing bubbles, our favorite duo swings colorful parasols filled with magical powers. Use parasols as a shield against enemy projectiles or stun, and pick up and throw foes as projectiles themselves!\n\nParasol Stars released in 1991 as the sequel to Rainbow Islands, marks the third installment in TAITO's massively successful Bubble Bobble series of action platformers and has lost none of its colorful charm throughout the years.\n\nHigh-score hunters can rejoice because just like in the bubble-filled predecessor skillful play will quickly fill the levels with sweet and fruity collectibles that can be gathered to climb the leaderboard.\n\nLook out for a variety of pick-ups to be found granting you all sorts of special powers from bouncing energy balls to screen-clearing magic.\n\nPlay on your own or bring a friend and take on the challenging levels together! Just like using enemies as projectiles, flinging your buddy against the enemies could be a good strategy. But be careful, as you won't only stun the enemy you hit but your buddy-turned projectile as well. In the 2-player co-op mode, tactical teamwork is key to clearing the levels and getting the highest scores.\n\n\nFeaturing:\n\n- Addictive arcade-style gameplay\n\n- Creative and clever game mechanics with magical Parasols\n\n- More Parasols! Enjoy the tactical depth of the action-filled 2-Player Co-op\n\n- A cosmic journey with 8 vibrant planets (and 2 secret bonus levels) \n\n- Catchy and memorable soundtrack\n\n\nParasol Stars is a retro gem brought back for modern consoles whose bright and beautifully crafted worlds will draw you in, and its simple but addictive 1- or 2-player gameplay will make you want to come back again and again to reach the top of the leaderboard.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/983372d4f0f46497dbb8d3aa320e378b629e5e7fb625fb0a4b0ff546f7142b43.jpg","id":"0100E7F01BB0C000","intro":"The third installment of TAITO's legendary Bubble Bobble series.\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en"],"name":"Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III","nsuId":70010000068281,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"ININ Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Mild Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240711,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ad37f3f768982996f0423e1935b87c5785e3292f89a8b1c5efa80a8319589709.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/af946be8c81fe5a04abb633aa9e308081c492664b87abe7d2a447e4c33143996.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ec21f4ca36bd21327f70e60c55d0e2f7b97442c77fedcf359db2dbf770ad4198.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/edf24ad9218f2fdc89d563baeddc7932738274b39c528b05fb784aa3ff18887a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fcd1c23c26334d7b449dec4401f45051fd170285b77a5fb0e53ade233c39d9e7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1e460e6bc3e390159fbf2f48e11eb6e9d57136009d52916f50f476410ca0005d.jpg"],"size":82837504,"version":null},"70010000070918":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/97cf22e77decb74c53be282d9cc0db472f0d07a35e4ba9bfc52a655f54e2c2d7.jpg","category":["Music","Multiplayer","Party"],"description":"Regardless of age or musical knowledge WEJAM allows you to create beautiful melodies and connect with people around the globe for a multiplayer jam session.

Players of the original game will feel right at home on this relentless voyage, even with the addition of new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a chest-thumping new soundtrack.\n\nWhile the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr the Viking 2 also (mercifully, begrudgingly) offers modern quality-of-life options such as checkpoints, save states, and an undead mode. You decide how punishing your quest should be \u2013 but now anyone can be a viking!\n\nWith new and larger worlds inspired by Norse mythology, multiple endings, and a variety of ruthless bosses to conquer, Volgarr the Viking 2 expands and improves on the original in every way.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history.
