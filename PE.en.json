Select a clan and attempt to settle this unwelcoming land, but you\u2019ll need to choose your strategy wisely to survive the ever increasingly harsh toll of winter and complete your saga.\n\nThe thrill of a dungeon crawler with the vibe of a city builder, Landnama is a survival strategy game that forces you to carefully decide your next step. Explore the land and discover hidden challenges and powerful landmarks. Build your settlement and brace for the punishing Winter\u2019s Toll. Settle each region with differently skilled clans while facing ever increasing challenges and no second chances.\n\nOnly one resource exists in the game, Heart, but it must be invested wisely. Heart can be gained in many ways, whether you want to focus on exploring the land as a hunting clan or by building your settlement into a thriving production hub. Establish a completed settlement before winter takes your final heart, but how you get there is up to you.\n\nThis isn't your typical Viking game, there is no combat or raiding. These are farmers, explorers, and builders. But conflict isn\u2019t missing, it comes in the form of a harsh winter that you\u2019ll need every bit of your focus to survive.\n\nLandnama is a taxing race against time with an ever present ticking clock pushing you always closer to winter, but it\u2019s also a beautiful world where you can freeze time and enjoy the atmospheric music and art.

Take control of Leah, a young cyborg lady, and overcome challenging trials to liberate her corrupted mind! \n\nA cyberpunk adventure\n\nIn the not-so-distant future, corporations rule the world providing ways of increasing the physical and intellectual capabilities of the common folk, at a high price...\n\nThose who wear cybernetic implants are doomed. Their lifetime is coming to an end in a matter of time, but luckily for them, there may still be hope. The biggest tech conglomerate just announced a promising solution for this terrible disease!\n\nYou play as Leah, a young cyborg lady who joins this experimental treatment to find a cure for what is killing augmented people. Overcome the trials to unlock your full mind potential and eliminate the corruption born from the implants that are destroying your neurons.\n\nGame mechanics\n\nFast-paced gameplay - Eden Genesis offers a wide world full of trials that require anticipation, quick reflexes, and nerves of steel. These sections contain both environmental and enemy hazards, besides frantic platforming puzzles. Players must overcome them to cure the illness suffered by the protagonist.\n\nResponsive controls - The game features an intuitive level design for the players to enjoy precise movement controls. As you become more skilled and Leah liberates more neuron links, Eden Genesis allows you to get even faster completion times every time you enter a trial. In a game with such scale and platforming, responsive controls are a must-have, allowing precise movement and combat.\n\nA balanced platformer - While any player will be able to reach the end of the game and complete the main story and numerous secondary phases, it is true that Eden Genesis offers some extra content for demanding players. Many of the trials are optional, and these offer a level of difficulty that only the most experienced will be able to overcome. However, the main playable and exploration core is designed to be accessible to all players.\n\nDeep story - Eden Genesis features a stunning plot including philosophic themes and debates about what makes us humans and the limits of science and technology. As every good cyberpunk story does, Eden Genesis makes the player question reality, and have uncertainty about the future.\n\nFuturistic setting - The world of Eden Genesis presents a future in which technological megacorporations dominate every aspect of everyday life. Neon lights and cybernetic implants are the protagonists of a unique 2D artistic design, which gives life to an immersive cyberpunk universe.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/dd9e6d6631750d4fc1a6fd688dc9a744abf7596f2d2f41864f519e1b5cb111f0.jpg","id":"0100D9D01D4B2000","intro":"A fast-paced platformer set in a cyberpunk world","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es"],"name":"Eden Genesis","nsuId":70010000076860,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Aeternum Game Studios","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence","Language","Mild Blood"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240912,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6dc52ddfe68fb078d800a90a4873240a5be84010fb681c9e73fb8bbe97af3ffa.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8d51102bc2e0e9ce27836adce3295455317aaf5b81a9948b73dbb1f055ab0d48.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/036b7c3ddb294b7c84e0857e51f669b89fd8f0ad567d593ff40544a9f88e90b8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/dabce794876e05dd4ca0b1817cd8a80a6f998717efec64483e067024c73a92de.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/44835cac307df9a667231459bdda0e995443021058544cc86c5f8710286870c5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5165e182e023d7be1bc17a626575faaba917acec9d6d7258478caed7446aa685.jpg"],"size":1272971264,"version":null},"70010000077830":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/48c5a9b2453474bb12630ee84307dcbc9f9e8fdddceebbd1691cd5771cc95009.jpg","category":["First-Person Shooter","Shooter","Strategy","Action"],"description":"The spiritual successor to the epic strategy-shooter Void Bastards, Wild Bastards is a hybrid FPS/strategy game with heart-pounding tactical combat, detailed management systems, and a roguelike campaign.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects.

What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
