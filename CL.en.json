Loyal disciples, called Six-Sided Oracles, were blessed by their star, granting them the strength to seal away the gift of heavenly bodies within mystic relics.\n\nAll was perfect and harmonious, until that one fateful day - The Crimson Dawn Cataclysm. A ferocious inferno sundered down from the sky, engulfing the entirety of the star system, crumbling the foundations of their society and corrupting the souls of the weak-willed. The disciples of the star were lost to the chaos - their creations scattered across a vast world of ruin. Could there still exist those who were capable of wielding their power?\n\nEons later, descendants of the Six-Sided Oracles embark on a journey to finish the failed battle that their predecessors started and save their star system.\n\nFeature List\n\nUnique dual \u201cdamage\u201d system: Purification vs Corruption - In Astrea there is a new type of \u201cdamage\u201d system. Purification can be used to damage enemies or heal yourself. On the other hand, corruption can be used to damage yourself or heal the enemies.\n \nPacify enemies through Purification, or Corrupt yourself to unleash abilities that help tip the scales.\n\nDynamic Health Bar system - With skills attached to your health bar, you can take Corruption to enable these skills and unleash powerful abilities. But be careful, if you take too much Corruption you will be consumed by it.\n\nNot cards, but dice! - Build a dice pool that fits your playstyle. Choose from over 350 dice and three dice types; reliably safe, perfectly balanced, or powerfully risky. A dice type system designed with high-risk, high-reward in its core.\n\nCustomize your dice - Forge your fate by editing die faces with new actions, tipping the odds of powerful results into your favor.\nChoose from Six Brave Oracles - Each possessing their own unique dice sets, abilities, and playstyles. From ingenious spellcasters to brutish berserkers, whether you like beating the opponent into submission or outsmarting them with clever plays, there\u2019s an oracle for you.\n\n20 Upgradeable Support Sentinels - Enchanted constructs that offer supportive dice rolls making them reliable companions in the heat of battle.\n\nUncover Over 170 Modifying Blessings -Imbue your Oracle with unique passives yielding potent effects that change up your fundamental tactics. Choose between Star Blessings, passive effects with lower power, or Black Hole Blessings, powerful passive effects with a drawback.\n\nMore than 20 random events - Find mysterious locations that can change the course of your run.\n\nManipulate your enemies and control your fate - Enemies attack using their own die, making it possible for you to manipulate their die to change their intent.\n\n16 Difficulty Levels - Customize your experience using difficulty levels to test all your abilities.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4b95c59ed60207502d44b466aab853fb9a9b421ba92480ad8b29eccb69d6f3bf.jpg","id":"010071401A274000","intro":"An all new dice-deck-building roguelike, Astrea, has you chart a path through the ruins of a lost civilization as one of six brave Oracles.

Following a devastating, apocalyptic event, the world is filled with garbage, abandoned structures and angry robot turrets and it is your mission to clean it from this dusty mess.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around the player-controlled Round Thingy of Destruction that you have a full 360-degree control over, making smashing the iron ball so much more satisfying. But you must remember not to lose your ball. Behind you there\u2019s a metal grinder in each level ready to consume all of the balls (stop giggling, Gregg) you are too slow to repel.\n\n\n\nBut DESTRUCTURE is no ordinary arkanoid-like game, because the levels fight back! Destroy enough structures and you will alert some bloodthirsty turrets, and trust us, they are definitely not happy to see you. Using all your finesse, you must dodge their bullets, missiles, lasers and other looming dangers and the more you destroy, the more you have to dodge. Bullet hell aficionados rejoice!\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you might stumble upon mighty weapons and power ups to use in the spur of the moment. It\u2019s like finding a nickel on the side-walk, but the nickel is a rocket launcher or a laser gun and the side-walk is the debris of a structure that once had some semblance of purpose.\n\n\n\nProgressing through the world of DESTRUCTURE is a tough and unforgiving job. For one, there are evil robots trying to murder you and the environments are filled with various hazards. That\u2019s why your benefactors have provided you with a wide array of unlockable tools, upgrades and perks that should provide enough leverage to give you a fighting chance. They\u2019re not free though, so remember to collect Blue Stuff (whatever it is) that your benefactors will use for very important deeds no one really knows or indeed cares about. You\u2019d be best suited collecting as much as you possibly can. That is, if you don\u2019t get shot while you\u2019re at it!\n\nWith this Blue Stuff you can purchase exciting new toys like \u201cZeus\u2019 Blessing\u201d, \u201cSuicidal Turrets\u201c or just some good old \u201cNapalm Rain\u201c to ascend the ranks of ordinary, trash-fighting Round Thingys of Destruction! and become the ultimate destroyer of what remains of the dusty, barren worlds of DESTRUCTURE.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9a841a2935f488334a8ac5d9fb7ae8711bcd6779132108c3bd6248ed0854e2b9.jpg","id":"010007501C53C000","intro":"DESTRUCTURE: Among Debris is an intense mix of brick breaker, air hockey and bullet hell set in a post apocalyptic world.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it","zh"],"name":"DESTRUCTURE: Among Debris","nsuId":70010000070345,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"RockGame","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240926,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4ec575dd4c22698bfcc7b5c118d2f31967bb7f0087ff99bc1adce9433c095f98.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d3bb76340ed9492bcf6b15753243cb4bd6e6574db60f660e9ef9cb49b98104aa.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e77f94628a73c49ef97fcef31820a1bfd78066295c0c4fc353a61d3fd7b31c91.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bdff1b4e1d7e85c38692b55e94be83f675e7659c22cc708223ddc73f020d7b0c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fec339cfb0961fa58b0229ef2bba3bdc0f75ec2cfc3404bef80dd4eec1c33a1e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f6ee3248802f753ab1cc693a32cf85e9329976964bf301a9e9fb576bd064ffa1.jpg"],"size":780140544,"version":null},"70010000074080":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/029ebb5de66fa9529a7cf639a77e03d4ae6184351861ca261db5ebb524226d82.jpg","category":["Strategy","Multiplayer","Shooter"],"description":"It's been twenty five years since the intrepid invertebrates flung themselves onto our screens.

With three difficulty settings to choose from, players can put their skills to the test, where a higher difficulty is rewarded with an even more challenging boss battle.\n\nMULTIPLAYER COUCH CO-OP\nWho says you have to take on The Meat invasion alone?

You\u2019ll also need to figure out how to reach hard-to-access areas as you navigate through lands occupied by imperial forces.\n\nThe story begins when Ahro starts experiencing frequent and distressing breakdowns. After finding only mild relief from herbal medicine, he sets out in search of a legendary miracle cure. As events unfold, the mysteries will both deepen and come into focus.\n\nDEVELOPED BY Oeh Interactive:\n\"Ahro is an experience about anxiety, working through your past, and coming to terms with it all. The game was born out of my personal struggle with panic disorder. I wanted to place the focus on an ordinary character dealing with his own issues and then place the wars and world changing events in the background (like it is for most of us).

Embark on an exciting adventure fit for both new players and long-time fans, highlighting classic and new SaGa franchise features, full Japanese and English voiceovers, rearranged compositions, and much more! \n\nSTORY \nIn an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist.\nThe knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.\n\n\u25a0Free-Form Scenario \nThe game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first\u2014from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey.\n\n\u25a0Combat \nThe strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!\n \n\u25a0Graphics \nThe original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.\n \n\u25a0Difficulty Settings \nSelect from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). \nCasual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.\n\n\u25a0Music & Voices \nKenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements!

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
