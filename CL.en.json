Any being who dared set foot in this underground labyrinth, filled since ancient times with poisonous gasses and demons, would succumb within a single minute.\n\nWhen witch Tia, who had previously fallen on hard times and given up her home, schemes to claim the dungeon's riches and buy back her abode, she encounters a hellhound who calls herself the demon queen. Tia borrows the queen's body, and, alongside the magical lifeform Doll, ventures forth into peril.\n\nThus begins the adventures of the unlikely trio: witch Tia, magical lifeform Doll, and demon queen Lilith.\n\nGame Summary:\nIn Doll Explorer, a deckbuilding turn-based strategy game, you'll set off on a perilous adventure, combining various actions for Doll to perform in order to defeat enemies and maneuver around traps, all while evading the poisonous fog closing in from behind. \n\nMake your way--cautiously yet surely--through the dungeon in search of the treasure that slumbers in its depths. Take note of enemies and traps, choosing the best actions and path forward. Don't forget to make use of Tia's stockpile of sorcery.\n\nWhen you defeat enemies, materials will drop that can be used to enhance your character's abilities.

Some just require a few upgrades here and there. Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you!\nDid we mention wildfires?\n\nTrackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way.\n\nThe game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists.\n\nGATHER RESOURCES\nThere aren't many resources in the desert, so you\u2019ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way.\n\nUNLOCK BLUEPRINTS\nYou\u2019ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, it\u2019s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely.\n\nBUILD\nWith enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key.\n\nDEFEND\nAttacks are frequent. You\u2019ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, you\u2019ll have to be more creative with how you use them.\n\nKEEP THE TRAIN GOING\nFeed your train with fuel, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything. Try to automate things to keep moving as the game gets harder and harder with time and distance.\n\nFEATURES\n- High replayability value\n- Many items to gather and craft\n- Multiple game modes\n- Mini quests to complete\n- Random deterministic map generator","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8a14f6a207f6d8acbb157c58be888701450234566f216dad3053b97e3870ab59.jpg","id":"0100AD801E6F8000","intro":"Embark on a thrilling journey through an unforgiving desert.

By dint of sword, and by way of magical objects known as \u201crune-lenses,\u201d the land\u2019s history has been shaped by the alliances and aggressions of the humans, beastmen, elves, and desert people who live there.\n\nThe Galdean Empire has edged out other nations and discovered a technology that amplifies the rune-lenses\u2019 magic.\n\nNow, the Empire is scouring the continent for an artifact that will expand their power even further. It is on one such expedition that Seign Kesling, a young and gifted imperial officer, and Nowa, a boy from a remote village, meet each other and become friends.\n\nHowever, a twist of fate will soon drag them into the fires of war and forces them both to reexamine everything they believe to be right and true.\n\nEiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes became the #1 funded Kickstarter video game of 2020 thanks to phenomenal support from the community. 505 Games is truly honored to publish Eiyuden Chronicle and work with Rabbit & Bear to help deliver a memorable gaming experience to fans. The goal of Rabbit & Bear and 505 Games is to make sure Eiyuden Chronicle reaches its true potential and delivers a worthwhile JRPG the community will enjoy.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/71a66e94c5b743191112afbba2d590be56cf9765783678616122c34b7c56a9f1.jpg","id":"0100ED9018F3E000","intro":"The JRPG is back with a new host of heroes.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","it","ru"],"name":"Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes","nsuId":70010000056455,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"505 Games","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence","Language","Mild Suggestive Themes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240423,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1da4e1bc3969fc5bce9440e849be23e5c2de7cb4389f7ea0ad4011a6ac20b41e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f22d5b813c237053ad2c337cec6fea17aeabc65a18c43beac21166d6cbc1f9c9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/753ef25a9a5ae61b33a8c99cf6c39f7fc804d4748a129b66358811777eb2d97a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8761ffcf69f150531ffbe2a153b92e357ee530ffc3c867783fc7aabf1ec0c902.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bc458045cc7c2d4078506744e73266f3ed033a20c0d4b2ded049864101df854f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d904332c8343a43581aef3c51cd301e3df80fd713c57701eaad35ae2e3602855.jpg"],"size":29842472960,"version":null},"70010000071814":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1ceba8c988789590a652736fbd5a12d9537475c50d703a5725c8178e2ed037da.jpg","category":["Arcade","Fighting","Action","Multiplayer"],"description":"Re-experience the 2017 arcade classic with 3 additional stages and 6 additional boss battles!
