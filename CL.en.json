Snow Bros. Wonderland is the newest chapter\u2014and boy, has a lot changed in the last couple of decades! For starters, the graphics aren\u2019t two-dimensional anymore; the new game offers a gorgeous 3D isometric style. Armed with an endless supply of ice pellets, gamers can turn monsters into snowballs, which can be kicked to destroy whole hordes of foes! Attacks can be chained to take down multiple enemies at once, and your snowball skills will be put to the ultimate test against some truly massive bosses. Are you (snow)man enough to defend Snow Land from evil King Atchich?\n\nFOUR TIMES THE FUN\nPreviously, Snow Bros. was always a two-player game (which makes perfect sense given the name), but this time, the number of players has doubled! Now, you can have up to four players at once, making the adventure even more fun to experience. After all, shared joy is double the joy, and quadrupled joy is even better! Oh, and did you know that you can also customize your snowy avatar with hats, goggles, scarves, and all kinds of fun stuff? Find your own style!\n\nTHE HISTORY OF SNOW BROS\nThe first game in the chilly, snowy Snow Bros. saga was released in 1990, featuring two snowman brothers, Nick and Tom, who rolled snowballs, jumped on platforms, and defeated enemies in a quest to rescue the princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi. Four years later, the sequel, Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves\u2014a game as quirky and bizarre as it was wonderfully entertaining\u2014was released. But despite the love for the first two Snow Bros. games, we haven\u2019t had a true third entry in the series. Until now.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
