Though the vehicle has grown old, it has become a cornerstone of your family's legacy. Now, in the blink of an eye, your father's gone. Now, the food truck belongs to you. Will you walk in your father's footsteps and live up to his name? Only one way to find out.\n\nYou can't take the 'truck' out of 'food truck'. Before you can set your stalls up, you have to actually get from your garage to wherever you decide to vend for the day. Be mindful of traffic, and congestions too! When you feel you're short on time do as your father did and veer off the beaten path. First come, first served!\n\nYou might've thought that all there is to this business is fast food, but now that you're on the other side of the counter it's time to think again. Even so much as a slice of cheese can turn a classic burger into a cheeseburger special. So, what will it be, sir? Ketchup or mustard?\n\nCustomers can be impatient and needy a lot. You'll find that you don't have all that much time to get them what they want and fit their palate as well. It'll be a challenge, but it's one your father has overcome, and surely so can you. Practice makes perfect, so go and knock them off their feet with your quality food!\n\nAs your prestige grows, so does your repertoire of tricks and tools. Stay up to date with your fame as you follow your in father's footsteps. Make sure to outfit yourself with the newest, top-of-the-line equipment you (and your wallet) can muster. Ride the wave of fame.\n\nThe truck belongs to you and as the hands that own it change, so too should its d\u00e9cor. Adjust anything from the exterior's color to the interior layout, the bumpers, lights, and wheels. Show the city you're no less than your father was and hit the streets like you own them.\n\nEach day is a new adventure, and each adventure requires sufficient provisions. Ingredients aren't permanent and will rot and spoil as the hours tick on by. Remember to stock up on not only the freshest but most desirable produce your clientele might demand of you.\n\nThe truck is dirty and has fallen to disrepair. Honour dad's memory by polishing it one last time. It's been a while since the truck has seen any use. Grab a bucket and a sponge, find a broom and get to cleaning. You'll need to be thorough, and it might take a while to make the truck spick and span, but now you have a duty to fulfill. Get to it!\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Renovating and expanding food truck.\n- Wide range of customization options.\n- Large catalogue of equipment options to choose from.\n- Create your own recipes.\n- Driving with traffic system.\n- Detailed cooking system.\n- Different locations across an entire city with different types of customers.\n- Various events.\n- Managing\n- Living city with dynamic day and night cycle.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/85c1724f18a0cf4aecd0b8ee98d17664f130c258473bf61b57e56c0f1c9e5cea.jpg","id":"010060B01EA2A000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","it","ru","zh","zh"],"name":"Food Truck Simulator","nsuId":70010000079410,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Ultimate Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Tobacco Reference"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240702,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de9f5322514fabf14c389fd85019d2495ccb2db92e5ae1c739d1ae6df9a1aacc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b5230fcc318a2bbf09d6888b6bed0d65c6ec19bd572286e254a4c385ae07bf7b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b0b2565ebb4382b614096c0a23733de26f24dd5b59f7d77dee5681007d535e91.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/04d5f2cd02f5b12dfa08716b6e0f45f7cc9ebd9eaa3b2c072b0f5eed714e9e3c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80ebe9169d167d5827bec604fc79d147d3d49183f3870d0e8e5b95f895dce360.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/20701429d5ae730184ea75e809b937d466654aac70bb6e19749f491acf66b4ef.jpg"],"size":2318401536,"version":null},"70050000049708":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f41416ea9943f9f6ac9351a3a1a3b8ddad91af17c0745056968592752b23f68e.jpg","category":null,"description":"A Frog's Job - Level Pack 1.\n\nTry to save 12 new frog souls in this DLC, and use the time-stopping mechanic to solve a new set of challenging levels.\n\nThe level pack doesn't follow the main game level order, you can start them right-away.\n\nDon't let the poor frog souls in limbo and save them now!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Save 12 new frog souls\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"A Frog's Job - Level Pack 1","nsuId":70050000049708,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Ratalaika Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Mild Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240702,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4226df178c3d536f146d10d72f9611f72139b5741edd76516af1a5609617779f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fa025cc56b18622420077b79efd45f54b2fc17691f0e17d35263d8dc5ae5460f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7b9292e88acc8c75d55cc232ed4d7383da228f4cad98ec9c5a69aa22a8508fa7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df4c9109189e73534c6d100101eaf0fc8725d86d86c206ac6cedd75c04f088b8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9638754a52808909b4ab929de5a2f44cc53ee8680372e50f081c2710b40c09c8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/552f861e6f90781330a80dd1aeca44af55e2665320090b17948d34d052ffd7ca.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000049710":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b0314ff59e84cf020026b8272e0e34420a02a3a987b9d80100da96cade4d0495.jpg","category":null,"description":"\"A Frog's Job - Level Pack 2.\n\nTry to save 12 new frog souls in this DLC, and use the time-stopping mechanic to solve a new set of challenging levels.\n\nThe level pack doesn't follow the main game level order, you can start them right-away.\n\nDon't let the poor frog souls in limbo and save them now!\"\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Save 12 new frog souls\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"A Frog's Job - Level Pack 2","nsuId":70050000049710,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Ratalaika Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Mild Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240702,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/55e7893e92b06ad93e61a29573477ad577a8c87495dd37acb170db68917da0f9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/72a89a70d4f4787a6f50a8617a8a3c093ef1ad8ca30b12106e55d2802b8deb93.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cb448a3d415f8dc2bc15162c2168568e8f12dde9033c94b4ed2b46ecc6c80331.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7fe2d222a72f736530475e59e827b854f477bee3f0f8bf370d0034880b868185.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/829c2508eafb7f636ab9aa8cb4e639d5965649ec2df10d781443a33d0b2d9320.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9d03d3a79e6fe259f38676db619c046a940f7d3172e0e15f88fc22afd78f9593.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70010000058135":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/eacd50be42325ebb444182bf61dffc462fceb1a2a5eb86bf1db706b7fcd73791.jpg","category":["Platformer","Action","Fighting","Party"],"description":"Climb huge mountains, impale hundreds of enemies, and solve tricky physics puzzles... all using only a spear.

Peach Boy) and his allies, Kintaro and Issuntaro, wiped out the tribe of ogres who plagued the Japanese countryside, and everyone lived happily every after.\n\n...Until now, anyway.\n\nCenturies later, Momotaro's descendant -- bored of life as a bar host (!) -- decides to run amok and terrorize the Japanese countryside with mononoke and yokai and all those other Japanese mysticism-related things you've probably heard the tiniest bit about from some anime somewhere. Not because it's his destiny or anything; just because he CAN.\n\nWith the hero now serving as villain, it's time to flip the script and turn the villains into heroes!

Ran, Hana, and Yume -- sisters who are descended from the very ogres Momotaro once took down -- must join forces with a kitty cat named Iroha who serves as their mentor, narrator, and caregiver (?) to rid the world of the pink, peachy menace and his fairytale folkhero-turned-villain flunkies in this action-packed tongue-in-cheek Japanese-inspired beat-em-up other-words-separated-by-hyphens romp-o-rama!\n\nWhat kind of game is it, you ask?

This year marks 30 years since the original release of \u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d (PC-9801 ed.) in 1993. In this title, the graphics were newly redrawn by Takami Akai, who directed production and worked on character design for the original \u201cPrincess Maker\u201d series at Gainax.\n\nAbout \u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d\n\u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d is a childrearing simulation game in which the player experiences being the father to a daughter granted to them by the stars.\nThey raise the girl for eight years, from ages ten to eighteen. Your daughter grows up to be an adult through various experiences in the game. The girl\u2019s dream is to become a princess, but a wide variety of opportunities await depending on how you raise her. What kind of dream will you make come true for this girl?\n\nRedrawing the graphics\nThis title is based on \u201cPrincess Maker 2: Refine,\u201d released in 2004. Especially important graphics were redrawn by Takami Akai in a style similar to the PC-98 version. The graphics are drawn in high resolution befitting modern game systems, with a commitment to quality in the details.\n\nAddition of an opening animation\nAn opening animation by Yonago Gainax has been added to the game. The animation, drawn by a team led by Takami Akai, envisions the future the player will have as the \u201cfather\u201d with their \u201cdaughter\u201d.\n\nKnowing how your daughter is doing is the first step in raising her\nThis title is a social simulation, so it is very important to always be aware of your daughter's status and use this to raise her.\nIn \u201cRegeneration\u201d, parameters for assessing your daughter's status are always available, so you can check on her at a glance. Check what you should do for your daughter\u2019s future, and raise her carefully.\n\nMessage from Takami Akai\nI am deeply grateful to see that \u201cPrincess Maker 2\u201d, which came out 30 years ago, is still so beloved by so many fans that we can release a new version. This time I was finally able to redo the graphics, which I had always wanted to do. Please enjoy the newly redrawn vacations and endings.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b147ba5e132e67b6665c6859b3c12d2f22812ae5cf35dc3dbd9af2436dfad3e6.jpg","id":"0100D4F01ABF2000","intro":"Dad, it's time to start our journey together!

Use parasols as a shield against enemy projectiles or stun, and pick up and throw foes as projectiles themselves!\n\nParasol Stars released in 1991 as the sequel to Rainbow Islands, marks the third installment in TAITO's massively successful Bubble Bobble series of action platformers and has lost none of its colorful charm throughout the years.\n\nHigh-score hunters can rejoice because just like in the bubble-filled predecessor skillful play will quickly fill the levels with sweet and fruity collectibles that can be gathered to climb the leaderboard.\n\nLook out for a variety of pick-ups to be found granting you all sorts of special powers from bouncing energy balls to screen-clearing magic.\n\nPlay on your own or bring a friend and take on the challenging levels together! Just like using enemies as projectiles, flinging your buddy against the enemies could be a good strategy. But be careful, as you won't only stun the enemy you hit but your buddy-turned projectile as well. In the 2-player co-op mode, tactical teamwork is key to clearing the levels and getting the highest scores.\n\n\nFeaturing:\n\n- Addictive arcade-style gameplay\n\n- Creative and clever game mechanics with magical Parasols\n\n- More Parasols!

Aside from the usual responsibilities of a headmaster, you are also tasked with managing various issues that originate outside the school, including mysterious dangers and potential threats that might cause things to go bananas!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1375ca4ed00529dbb937f9162d7306ee00eadd3f381c69f9d62caa75196d5344.jpg","id":"0100F4C01EBC6000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","fr","de","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Let's School","nsuId":70010000079865,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PM Studios","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240716,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5f28f3da111201f968fa7968f346fb314254bdc73eabfeeba951fcef8c0a078f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9c9b6d1b9246720a06bbe0c7ccd1bbfa5ec298587694ef7ef114ea06f9524285.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bcaba30f0fcdc72de2393e5084b70ab15cf49379caea539b075451b25950cac2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fa9e2f42e51e6b71f08db299037cfc7da1230cb20e0277f3d716f673e3caefdf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1d31f72b234f6c07984521f4cd55a21e2c2edc3a6ae31d3598c4da48bfe3ae4a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6bf2409bb4fc84f80a3c7f6f40a50f09985d5b450b85f2fa64cc34781b814757.jpg"],"size":487587840,"version":null},"70010000078903":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/afd69fe91d97e30e3b4160898a048090e326f6d063b815c4c50129a4555ef1ab.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","Fighting","Multiplayer"],"description":"When Splinter is kidnapped by Shredder, mysterious portals simultaneously appear across NYC.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects.

Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
