Those are just a few of the important factors to consider when approaching a shot. In addition, you'll need to closely examine the layout of the golf course. Remember that it will be challenging to hit the ball from a bunker full of sand, and when the ball lands in the water, you'll have to play it from the last known position.\n\n\nVARIED LOCATIONS\nVisit Pristine Pines, Dusty Dunes, Grand Grove, and Serene Sky. Each of these maps features unique obstacles such as scorpions, and gusty winds that will try to stop or destroy your golf ball. To progress through the maps, you'll need to win a tournament on each, placing in the top 3 of the leaderboard.\n\n\nBUY NEW TECH!\nDuring your journey, you'll have the option to purchase additional equipment with coins. Acquiring these technologies will allow you to move the ball in unconventional ways, giving you a slight advantage over opponents or more fun.

Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!\n\nWith a highly customisable class system, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging loot that truly changes the way you play: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.\n\nKeeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat. After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each procedurally generated adventure. If you\u2019re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with 6 different difficulty levels \u2013 or pick Hardcore Mode with permadeath, where every battle can be the last!\n\nAlso features Roguelike Mode, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!\n\nCarve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield.
