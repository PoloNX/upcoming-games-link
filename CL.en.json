Embark on an ever-changing journey, build your own bestiary, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash special powers.\n\nBecome a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time!\n\nINKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA\n700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their \u201cmemes\u201d and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You\u2019ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more\u2026\n\nFIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI\nInkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent.\n\nMULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK\nDonkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more.

Use your fists to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too.\n\nADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE\nEach Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you\u2019re on). But it\u2019s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati\u2019s army on each specific Battlefield.\n\nA SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN\nUncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen!

Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!\n\nWith a highly customisable class system, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging loot that truly changes the way you play: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.\n\nKeeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat. After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each procedurally generated adventure.

A lone island, sitting in the middle of an endless ocean, and the site of a magical phenomenon known only as the Rift. It was once a source of limitless power for humanity, through magical creatures called the Ateyan. Capable of incredible and wonderful feats of magic, they lived alongside humanity for centuries - until something destroyed this harmony. The Ateyan disappeared, becoming motes of light on an almost deserted island. Human civilizations crumbled, its formerly great cities and industry reclaimed by nature. Generations passed in the shadow of ancient splendor. Then, something happened: The Rift began consuming the island, threatening the survival of humanity's remnants.\n\nMonster Tribe puts you in the shoes of humanity's last hope, a sage born with a natural connection to the Ateyan, capable of calling them forth from the void between the real world and the Rift. Set out across Akama, collect an army of Ateyan, train them, and unearth long-forgotten secrets. Why did Akama fall? What caused the Ateyan to disappear into the void? Can the rift be stopped?\n\nCan a single human make a difference?\n\nIsland of Akama\n\nThe vast island has a long and terrible history. The disappearance of the Ateyan destroyed human civilization, leaving behind precious few survivors - and an endless array of secrets waiting to be discovered.\nAwaken the Ateyan! Living within the void between the real and the Rift, they can be seen as motes of light floating across the island. Use the hero's connection to awaken them, and harness their power once more!\n\nExplore ancient ruins and foreboding wilds. Gather resources to upgrade your equipment and help the awakened Ateyan grow and train. You'll need it.\n\nUncover lost lore and terrible secrets of those who came before. Can you survive long enough to reveal the frightening truth of what happened on Akama?\n\nThe Rift\n\nNature has reclaimed Akama's great cities from humanity, and it will not relinquish its conquests easily. Neither will the Ateyan simply surrender after centuries of peace from mankind.\n\nCommand teams of monsters in turn-based combat: Battles take place on a grid, where teams of up to four Ateyan square off against one another. Think, strategize, and prevail!\n\nDevelop a mighty team capable of facing the Rift. As your Ateyan gather experience, manage their development using a flexible RPG-style character system.\n\nOvercome the ultimate challenges, entering the ancient Towers that dot the landscape of Akama.

Take advantage of Lilac\u2019s speed with her Dragon Boost, reach new heights with Carol\u2019s Jump Disc or motorcycle, or take a more measured approach with Milla\u2019s shield. And all-new playable character Neera won\u2019t be left out in the cold, as she can use her powerful Frost Arts to punish foes. Like its predecessor, this high-speed platforming adventure delivers exhilarating momentum-based action, but advances the formula with new gameplay systems and enhancements.\n\nWith 24 expertly designed stages, an ambitiously expanded Adventure mode, retro-but-refined 2D visuals, and the addition of the highly requested Boss Rush mode, Freedom Planet 2 is the indie darling grown up to become a true platforming power.\n\n\u25c6More Ways to Play\nExplore Avalice in Adventure mode, meeting over 100 NPCs along the way. After saving the world, zoom straight into the action in Classic mode or challenge your fiercest foes in the new Boss Rush mode.\n\n\u25c6Heroines to the Rescue\nFoe-turned-friend Neera joins the bombastic cast of all-female protagonists, each with their own unique abilities and perspective on a story reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon adventure.\n\n\u25c6The Brave and the Bold\nStage too hard? Too easy? Customize the difficulty with the new equippable item system that will let you change the rules of the game\u2014try summoning a helpful shield orb at the start, transform all item boxes into bombs, or any of the numerous other ways to dial the challenge up or down.\n\n\u25c6Fight Smarter, Live Longer\nThe new Guard button lets you parry enemy attacks\u2014sometimes with added benefits\u2014and the new Revival system lets you risk an extra life for a chance to make a comeback and eke out that tough victory.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/81f11a486825a5195e0db0c4aba8b5e48bd982ac580f4e7d52368cfdefd5553a.jpg","id":"01009A301B6D8000","intro":"The high-speed platforming of Freedom Planet returns with new features and more ways to play!
