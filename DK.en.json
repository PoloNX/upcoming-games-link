Finally, within their grasp... A vampire. Possibly, at least. \n\nThe sun has set on Dracula's Castle once more, and as the moon rises a hellish horde of murky Mudmen, ghastly ghosts, and frightening Fleamen take the stage as the battle of good and evil rages once again. Unleash an arsenal of new Vampire-vanquishing weapons upon these beasts and leave a trail of doom in your wake before attempting to rid the world of the unspeakable terror himself. Do not be blind to the shadow that looms over you Survivors, as your quest has only just begun! It's all very serious stuff, so now let's pump up the volume and let's go, this is Castlevania in Vampire Survivors, baby! \n\n20+ New characters \nWhat a horrible night to have a curse, especially if you are: \n\nThe Belmonts, your favorite whip-obsessed family of vampire hunters, including Simon, Richter, Trevor, and even Sonia. \nThe Belnades, a myriad of legendary witches from throughout the history of the occult clan. Sypha, Yoko, and even distant relatives like Charlotte Aulin and Maria Renard have their spellbooks ready. \nOther Heroes, not just Jonathan and Charlotte, but Jonathan Morris AND John Morris?! Amazing allies abound, from Shanoa to Eric Lecarde. \n\n40+ New weapons \nFighting the forces of evil is hard as hell: \n \nWhips: Whole lot of whips. More whips than we can count (it's eight).\nSpells: elemental magic has finally made its way in Vampire Survivors, offering a wide array of spells inspired by Portrait of Ruin, Harmony of Dissonance, and Order of Ecclesia \nMagic weapons: not any sword, but Alucard's Sword. And Alucard's Spear. Also Alucard's Shield. Etc. \nProjectiles: do you remember that time the Morris' were throwing javelins and iron balls? \nGlyphs: Confodere, Vol Confodere, Melio Confodere, but also plenty of non-Confodere, we swear. \n\nSPECIAL WEAPON SELECTORS \nSome of these characters are famous for having a large amount of different abilities, so we probably all had a different experience in playing them in their original games. It would be silly of us to force you using these characters with an unchangeable weapon, so... well we ARE actually going to force a weapon on you, but not for long! \nYou'll be able to unlock at least one Weapon Selector for every single character; for example the Morning Star will let you choose any whip as a starting weapon for your friendly neighborhood-Belmont\n\nA monstrously large Stage \nEnchanting mysteries and danger await those who enter: \n\nThe largest map Vampire Survivors has ever seen, stacked with sinister secrets and a bunch of baneful bosses. \n\n30+ New Music Tracks \nA ridiculous amount of remixes of Castlevania tracks from Vampire Survivors historic composers Daniele Zandara and Filippo Vicarelli, but also from fan-favorites Evelyn Lark and Keygen Church! \n\n- Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears, Simon's Theme, Leon's Theme, a lot of themes. \n- Moonlight Nocturne, Lost Paintings, Dance of Pearls, but like you've never heard them before. \n- Aquarius, The Beginning, Divine Bloodlines, everything that screams \"this is Castlevania\". \n- An Empty Tome, Invitation of a Crazed Moon, Pitch Black Intrusion, so many hits from the more recent entries in the series. \n- Amber Scenery, Sarabande of Healing, Jaws of a Scorched Earth, and many others you didn't know the title of! \n\nOn top of that we have borrowed several dozens original tracks from Castlevania games. There is so much music we revamped the music selection panel for the occasion. \n\n-\nAnd the cherry on top: a man.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Everyone is here in Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania","nsuId":70050000052061,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"poncle","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Moderate Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20241031,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fe2f9efe2da5f6b231c37b1931353f62dfa4257ed8a6140c36cec5f45625aeea.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e6de9d922b712662d6ec1f99a861bf48aa8fbe07f97e6bc630aca49b2277d779.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/41bde592f77b12cad6c65d2ab5ca4d0daa9cf7e79c4f1e05601e96cf2745ab5c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d9a3f3ba84f931fb8581d95c24fc7c5a3df0983b4fc0ba0c8f6bbc4162455245.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/299be8a2df8e0ea5055a08c311dc5542cf16f0935e2d713d78c9759d48678488.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c6138c224f76a7dc623e4dd7887f8e021df68d449f35ff6328a726a8079cb96f.jpg"],"size":285212672,"version":null},"70010000077501":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7ba6557ff22778800bb7b2de4180f75e76a04c8330620c991f303f8b7dd2befd.jpg","category":["Action","RPG"],"description":"Marvelous and Hiro Mashima team up to present a brand-new adventure full of frantic monster combat and rewarding farming simulation.

Get ready to experience the cutest and most fun sports game you've ever played. With colorful graphics, adorable characters, and exciting gameplay, you'll have a blast competing in various sports activities. Let's play!\n\nLOCAL MULTIPLAYER\nYou can play with up to 4 people, making it perfect for game nights, family gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. Choose your characters, divide into two teams and prepare for endless hours of fun and laughter for everyone.\n\nNO RULES!\nEach sport has a set of rules to decide how points are scored... but nothing about how player should behave\u2026 So, feel free to block the basket, stun the opponent, block their way or invade the opponent's field!\n\nRANDOMLY GENERATED TERRAIN\nImagine playing a sports game where every time you start a new game, you encounter a completely new terrain. No match will ever be the same again!. Adapt your strategies to the ever-changing terrain to become the ultimate champion!\n\nSEVEN BALL SPORTS\nEnjoy playing classic sports like soccer or basketball and also discover other cultural sports like Pelota Vasca or Ulama that are not so well known but just as fun! Create championships choosing the sports you like the most and show your skills!\n\n- Soccer\nA classic, two goals and two teams. Whoever puts the ball into the opposing team's goal the most times wins. Take advantage of the curves and mushrooms in the environment to gain position or hit from higher.\n\n- Basket\nThis game consists of putting the ball through the opponent's metal hoop and is played with the hands... well, not in this case... Our friends have adapted it a bit to play... with the head... and huge wooden baskets!\n\n- American Football\nRunning after a strange shaped ball and hitting the opponent to take it away is a sport. Yes, and it is very intense. Grab the egg shaped ball and take it to a safe area avoiding being caught! Kick it if you are in trouble!\n\n- Tennis\nA sport where players try to hit a small, yellow ball over a net, without hitting it too hard or too soft. It's like a beautiful dance, but with more shouting and the occasional racquet smash. And good luck finding that little yellow ball in the bushes.\n\n- Volley Ball\nPass the ball to the field of the opposing team. In this case you can use the net both to bounce the ball and to climb on it with the help of the jumping mushrooms.\n\n- Basque Pelota\nHitting a rock-hard ball with your hand to send it against a wall? Yes, and it's really attractive! It is played in turns and each time the ball hits the wall, the team that serves changes. Be careful not to send it too low or too high.\n\n- Ulama\nWhat? Have you never heard of Ulama? Listen and enjoy. A traditional game in the Mayan culture that is played with the hips! Invade opponent field with the ball. In Narona you also play with your head. A huge ring on the wall means that if you pass the ball through it you get 5 points! Frankly fun!\n\nCUTE CHARACTERS\nFive girls and five boys are the brave ones who have gone out to the forests of Narona to play and have fun. With different speed, strength and jump force, each one takes advantage of its skills in each sport. The smart girl, the lazy boy, the big guy, the jock, the music fan, the strong one, the scared little one, the handsome and nice guy and the weird girl with the tattoos... there's room for everyone!\n\nSKINS AND REWARDS\nCustomize your experience by unlocking different skins for each character.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave.

Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Bad Language","Sex"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70050000050585":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d0f8326f0ae3795f25a28f38618490c6915b2c89f89e7a6a73867a3bdf68947c.jpg","category":null,"description":"Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII: Deluxe Cosmetics Pack includes the following in-game content:\n\n4 profile customizations\nEmbellish your player profile in Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII with these cosmetic customizations, including a striking new badge, a regal new title, an ornate new banner, and an eye-catching new portrait that will all make you stand out from other players! \n\n1 alternate scout skin\nGive your scout recon unit a brand new look with this cosmetic outfit!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Build Something You Believe In","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII: Deluxe Cosmetics Pack","nsuId":70050000050585,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"2K","rating":12,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250206,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000050586":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e5188375f84d63f918b0fb41391f8db313222e93519b72481748912a08ba11.jpg","category":null,"description":"A leader persona in Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII offers a new variant of an existing leader, including a different outfit and background for that leader, new gameplay bonuses, and an alternative agenda that reflects a different side of their personality!

Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
