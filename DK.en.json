Following a devastating, apocalyptic event, the world is filled with garbage, abandoned structures and angry robot turrets and it is your mission to clean it from this dusty mess.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around the player-controlled Round Thingy of Destruction that you have a full 360-degree control over, making smashing the iron ball so much more satisfying. But you must remember not to lose your ball. Behind you there\u2019s a metal grinder in each level ready to consume all of the balls (stop giggling, Gregg) you are too slow to repel.\n\n\n\nDestroy enough structures and you will alert some bloodthirsty turrets, and trust us, they are definitely not happy to see you. Using all your finesse, you must dodge their bullets, missiles, lasers and other looming dangers and the more you destroy, the more you have to dodge. Bullet hell aficionados rejoice!\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky you might stumble upon mighty weapons and power ups to use in the spur of the moment. It\u2019s like finding a nickel on the side-walk, but the nickel is a rocket launcher or a laser gun and the side-walk is the debris of a structure that once had some semblance of purpose.\n\n\n\nProgressing through the world of DESTRUCTURE is a tough and unforgiving job. For one, there are evil robots trying to murder you and the environments are filled with various hazards. That\u2019s why your benefactors have provided you with a wide array of unlockable tools, upgrades and perks that should provide enough leverage to give you a fighting chance. They\u2019re not free though, so remember to collect Blue Stuff (whatever it is) that your benefactors will use for very important deeds no one really knows or indeed cares about. You\u2019d be best suited collecting as much as you possibly can. That is, if you don\u2019t get shot while you\u2019re at it!\n\nWith this Blue Stuff you can purchase exciting new toys like \u201cZeus\u2019 Blessing\u201d, \u201cSuicidal Turrets\u201c or just some good old \u201cNapalm Rain\u201c to ascend the ranks of ordinary, trash-fighting Round Thingys of Destruction! and become the ultimate destroyer of what remains of the dusty, barren worlds of DESTRUCTURE.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9a841a2935f488334a8ac5d9fb7ae8711bcd6779132108c3bd6248ed0854e2b9.jpg","id":"010007501C53C000","intro":"DESTRUCTURE: Among Debris is an intense mix of brick breaker, air hockey and bullet hell set in a post apocalyptic world.

As Vadim, fight back against The Meat and stop the terrors spawned from scientist Yuri Markov's experiments on the Moon.\n\nMULTI-PHASE BOSS FIGHTS\nIron Meat pays homage to classic run-and-gun titles from the past, with intense boss fights fixed into multiple phases. With three difficulty settings to choose from, players can put their skills to the test, where a higher difficulty is rewarded with an even more challenging boss battle.\n\nMULTIPLAYER COUCH CO-OP\nWho says you have to take on The Meat invasion alone? With 2-player couch co-op, you can grab a buddy to leave a trail of bloody, Meat-infected corpses together! It's double the firepower, double the carnage, and double the MEAT!\n\nOVER 30 UNLOCKABLE SKINS\nYou don't have to be a soldier to fight against The Meat. Hell, you don't even have to be a HUMAN to do so! With over 30 unlockable skins to choose from, players can customize their character the way they want. Each skin comes with interchangeable parts, allowing for greater customization with mixing and matching. Want a shark head on a robot body with dinosaur feet? DONE. Maybe a half human, half doggo?

You\u2019ll also need to figure out how to reach hard-to-access areas as you navigate through lands occupied by imperial forces.\n\nThe story begins when Ahro starts experiencing frequent and distressing breakdowns. After finding only mild relief from herbal medicine, he sets out in search of a legendary miracle cure. As events unfold, the mysteries will both deepen and come into focus.\n\nDEVELOPED BY Oeh Interactive:\n\"Ahro is an experience about anxiety, working through your past, and coming to terms with it all. The game was born out of my personal struggle with panic disorder. I wanted to place the focus on an ordinary character dealing with his own issues and then place the wars and world changing events in the background (like it is for most of us). Ahro is not a warrior or a superhero, he\u2019s not saving the world. He\u2019s an average person who\u2019s experienced personal trauma and loss. Ahro is me and you.\" - Joel Vile, founder of Oeh Interactive\n\nPUBLISHED BY Nakana.io\n\u201cAhro had both a relaxing and strangely thrilling effect on me.

Embark on an exciting adventure fit for both new players and long-time fans, highlighting classic and new SaGa franchise features, full Japanese and English voiceovers, rearranged compositions, and much more! \n\nSTORY \nIn an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist.\nThe knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.\n\n\u25a0Free-Form Scenario \nThe game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first\u2014from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey.\n\n\u25a0Combat \nThe strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!\n \n\u25a0Graphics \nThe original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi.

Inspired and influenced by traditional animated films and other 2D video games, the old-school style gives life and fluidity of movement to the whole cast of characters.\n\nBreak the Fourth Wall\n\nWhat makes this game special is Morkull himself, his personality, and his ability to break the fourth wall to talk with the players like he was there in the room.\n\nMorkull possesses charisma and charm, and never fails to create a light-hearted atmosphere with his endless humor, bad jokes and pop culture references.\n\nCombat System\n\nYou'll have all the power of the God of Death and Darkness at your fingertips, of course, along with an ample selection of combos and abilities that will open up even the most remote corners of the Ragast.\n\nBecome Part of the Ragast and Join Our Community\n\nOnce you enter the Ragast, you'll never leave \u2013 unless you can get through Morkull\u2026 So why not join his ranks and support his Machiavellian cause with the rest of his champions as part of our Morkull Ragast's Rage community.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/baa3ee2b7e45527e2649781483b154b7d30a1d3fe1d540d7359f3c9d98091140.jpg","id":"01002B801D096000","intro":"Help Morkull escape this cursed Metroidvania video game!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es"],"name":"Morkull Ragast's Rage","nsuId":70010000072755,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Selecta Play","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Mild Swearing"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250116,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76cd1fa437fb2115696b3207273361a7c8d8dfb20af0e66e74bf3415091d037f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a0a9120d19b4e0c3ac18762b413682a4d7def6dd6e9103c8754b0a521a1b8976.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7df3ae4ebd15d4b2f831a0016dbe37087048e1a4d281ba20b90337ac70f48654.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e0923429fcd1bb55cdb20801644122e8c1689b27001fa395432421a8bb1cd46e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/829f3c13f8b2a8c32543d3d4ff149d328bb69966c2fce8bcfd3fc3e698ec0265.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5fe9643076cd57af6d541fe866985d10cf096e971a4eca45c2caf6bfcbb402bb.jpg"],"size":405798912,"version":null},"70010000084603":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6b56c7e52d3ae0461302df8daf1cc09496b9e07502e8636b1cff472cc0cfb811.jpg","category":["Platformer"],"description":"Help Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong recover their precious banana hoard from the villainous Tiki Tak Tribe in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD!

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew.

What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience.
