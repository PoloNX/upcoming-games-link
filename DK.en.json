Serving as humanity's gateway to the cosmos, it now stands as a chilling testament to an experiment gone wrong.\nAs the protagonist, you awaken in the cold sterility of the medical bay, disoriented and alone. The eerie silence is broken only by the hum of malfunctioning machinery. An unsettling darkness envelops the lunar base, casting shadows that seem to writhe and pulse with malevolence.\n\nExploring the abandoned corridors and chambers, you discover cryptic remnants of the crew's activities \u2013 hasty recordings, fragmented logs, and ominous experiments conducted in the name of advancing human knowledge. It becomes clear that the crew's scientific pursuits unleashed an ancient extraterrestrial force, one that feeds on fear and has twisted reality within the confines of AstroGenica Lunar Nexus.\nThe nightmare deepens as you encounter grotesque manifestations of the crew's worst fears brought to life by the insidious lunar entity. Each step forward reveals more about the base's descent into madness, and the horrifying fate that befell those who once called it home.\nArmed with only a flickering flashlight and your wits, you must navigate the increasingly nightmarish lunar landscape, solving puzzles, avoiding otherworldly threats, and piecing together the fragments of a dark cosmic secret. The lunar base holds the key to your survival, but it also harbors the eldritch horrors spawned by humanity's reckless curiosity.\n\nAs you inch closer to the heart of the lunar nightmare, the line between reality and delusion blurs, and the chilling truth awaits discovery. Will you unravel the mystery, or become another victim of the lunar entity's insatiable hunger for fear? The fate of AstroGenica Lunar Nexus rests in your hands, and the lunar nightmare may leave scars that transcend the boundaries of space and time.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/38bfa7ef85beec585d0841d14b82c5f8a300224b5e90107bb53923855fb85aca.jpg","id":"01004640200BC000","intro":"Lunar Nightmare is a retro-inspired sci-fi thriller, set on an abandoned Moon base...","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Lunar Nightmare","nsuId":70010000085021,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Playstige Interactive","rating":16,"ratingContent":["Strong Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240816,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c70efe32311becd84cb02557ec4b341bca557dabb1be8b1e5d91b3b0ea407d3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3a88f05074480da566d09a3629105d9f583dbb11e43f025817fd62adeac2a28e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4033faa163f6719ed469b5ef64589be6c4101e1f90554569a49e0b0f597a52a9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ddf509de69cae947cb0ff93144f7cca6d337594e3e3ef2bcdc4082b7bf765fdf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e09ad85e545c773db00d10a1b999a308e207bf851c093e7977a196e655aa72b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/95fd35818b7eead34ad21d097314849cc6abbc8a25446b4b75ed4d5f6141ae84.jpg"],"size":7600078848,"version":null},"70010000085188":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2a3ac697c34c172e42ce9ca60c54346c8b633975aa86bb03d6e47870849f3af9.jpg","category":["Adventure","Puzzle","Other"],"description":"Do you have what it takes to steal the treasure without leaving a trace?

Take control of Leah, a young cyborg lady, and overcome challenging trials to liberate her corrupted mind! \n\nA cyberpunk adventure\n\nIn the not-so-distant future, corporations rule the world providing ways of increasing the physical and intellectual capabilities of the common folk, at a high price...\n\nThose who wear cybernetic implants are doomed. Their lifetime is coming to an end in a matter of time, but luckily for them, there may still be hope. The biggest tech conglomerate just announced a promising solution for this terrible disease!\n\nYou play as Leah, a young cyborg lady who joins this experimental treatment to find a cure for what is killing augmented people. Overcome the trials to unlock your full mind potential and eliminate the corruption born from the implants that are destroying your neurons.\n\nGame mechanics\n\nFast-paced gameplay - Eden Genesis offers a wide world full of trials that require anticipation, quick reflexes, and nerves of steel. These sections contain both environmental and enemy hazards, besides frantic platforming puzzles. Players must overcome them to cure the illness suffered by the protagonist.\n\nResponsive controls - The game features an intuitive level design for the players to enjoy precise movement controls. As you become more skilled and Leah liberates more neuron links, Eden Genesis allows you to get even faster completion times every time you enter a trial. In a game with such scale and platforming, responsive controls are a must-have, allowing precise movement and combat.\n\nA balanced platformer - While any player will be able to reach the end of the game and complete the main story and numerous secondary phases, it is true that Eden Genesis offers some extra content for demanding players. Many of the trials are optional, and these offer a level of difficulty that only the most experienced will be able to overcome. However, the main playable and exploration core is designed to be accessible to all players.\n\nDeep story - Eden Genesis features a stunning plot including philosophic themes and debates about what makes us humans and the limits of science and technology. As every good cyberpunk story does, Eden Genesis makes the player question reality, and have uncertainty about the future.\n\nFuturistic setting - The world of Eden Genesis presents a future in which technological megacorporations dominate every aspect of everyday life. Neon lights and cybernetic implants are the protagonists of a unique 2D artistic design, which gives life to an immersive cyberpunk universe.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/dd9e6d6631750d4fc1a6fd688dc9a744abf7596f2d2f41864f519e1b5cb111f0.jpg","id":"0100D9D01D4B2000","intro":"A fast-paced platformer set in a cyberpunk world","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es"],"name":"Eden Genesis","nsuId":70010000076861,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Aeternum Game Studios","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Mild Swearing"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240912,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6dc52ddfe68fb078d800a90a4873240a5be84010fb681c9e73fb8bbe97af3ffa.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8d51102bc2e0e9ce27836adce3295455317aaf5b81a9948b73dbb1f055ab0d48.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/036b7c3ddb294b7c84e0857e51f669b89fd8f0ad567d593ff40544a9f88e90b8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/dabce794876e05dd4ca0b1817cd8a80a6f998717efec64483e067024c73a92de.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/44835cac307df9a667231459bdda0e995443021058544cc86c5f8710286870c5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5165e182e023d7be1bc17a626575faaba917acec9d6d7258478caed7446aa685.jpg"],"size":1272971264,"version":null},"70010000077831":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/48c5a9b2453474bb12630ee84307dcbc9f9e8fdddceebbd1691cd5771cc95009.jpg","category":["First-Person Shooter","Shooter","Strategy","Action"],"description":"The spiritual successor to the epic strategy-shooter Void Bastards, Wild Bastards is a hybrid FPS/strategy game with heart-pounding tactical combat, detailed management systems, and a roguelike campaign.

Embark on an exciting adventure fit for both new players and long-time fans, highlighting classic and new SaGa franchise features, full Japanese and English voiceovers, rearranged compositions, and much more! \n\nSTORY \nIn an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist.\nThe knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.\n\n\u25a0Free-Form Scenario \nThe game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first\u2014from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey.\n\n\u25a0Combat \nThe strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!\n \n\u25a0Graphics \nThe original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.\n \n\u25a0Difficulty Settings \nSelect from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). \nCasual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.\n\n\u25a0Music & Voices \nKenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements!

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history.
