Varying times of day and weather conditions can be a hindrance or provide cover, so you'll need to equip accordingly. New equipment and weapons are researched and added as the game progresses.\n\nTake on a friend in local head-to-head multiplayer with Spy against Spy!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8b46478ec9faf979eead06ddec1938ea1ea6dfc6dd8b43c406489982fb0f77a2.jpg","id":"0100661020C1A000","intro":"3D stealth action with modern effects, randomly generated missions, modern equipment, and local multiplayer!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","fr","es","de","it","zh","zh"],"name":"Spy Drops","nsuId":70010000087958,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"RAINYFROG","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250801,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2e5f424a636b5d2db0826703f2ed7519480a73f62ac089279a07c2ed57fc3adb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/71a8bb8a405e019f0fcd65feb12b680ccce09f6d2c17b8f53239e8cc594ea560.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/db64ecff127631d770972e132f98acdd3d54af8d4054dcbfdef4892c797d3ffe.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/838d7c34e9bc0d9420b3bf0694e793631f75cf72d912329cfa14477ff4bb4796.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a454e2b9a74f55d12911e325dff0b65177942c499b1694a65fc264d4d5cab370.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f5354e9fdf94fe14b7ee49a5ad981cafdf2eff0ae7903c9ad127a9866ee5fe6f.jpg"],"size":2598371328,"version":null},"70010000088115":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/23fba45eae28bcc09992d67ad25e1ee9fe3977409472e074da5ecc076e7799fb.jpg","category":["Adventure","RPG","Platformer"],"description":"A group of brave heroes must gather the fragments of the Magic Crystal to face the evil Black Knight and thus prevent the destruction of the kingdom.\n\nBe prepared to discover a huge open world to explore, with secrets and surprises in every corner.

Across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d of anime-inspired adventure, Ringo and Wolfe will have to work together to find answers, make up for past mistakes, and travel across the universe in search of their goal. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll learn how to get along at some point!\n\nTrained in the ways of Kiai, a magical form of martial art and also the universe\u2019s most exciting form of televised entertainment, Ringo can combine words to create customized attacks in intense turn-based battles. Defeat or befriend a cast of fearsome space pirates, mysterious scoundrels, cute witches, high school delinquents, talking crows, and skilled martial artists on your way to becoming a Kiai master.\n\nUSE YOUR WORDS\nCreate custom attacks by combining words up to the limit of your spirit level. The more spirit you have, the more slots you have to place words into and the more powerful and complex actions you can take.\n\nAll words have cool downs and opponents might be weak or strong against specific attacks or specific elements. You won\u2019t know which until you engage them in battle so you need to be prepared to improvise.\n\nCOLLECT THEM ALL\nWith over 200 words to collect across the game there is a near infinite number of possible unique attacks to make. As you expand Ringo\u2019s vocabulary you\u2019ll need to carefully select which words you take into battle, building strategies around your mix of categories, blend of offensive and defensive words, giving yourself options to manage your opponents weaknesses and strengths, consider optimizing the juggling of cool downs and, of course, which attacks sound the coolest.\n\nThe result is an accessible, immediately fun but deep combat system.\n\nSTEP UP WITH PEP UPS\nThe core ethos of the Kiai martial art is to fight with honor. Defeating an opponent with honor can turn the most heated of rivals into the fastest of friends! Befriend your rivals to earn their words of encouragement in the form of useful Pep Ups which can be equipped to give you special bonuses in combat.\n\nTHE STARS CALL\nTravel the universe on a rollercoaster adventure as you seek the pieces of the Wanderstar map, Ringo\u2019s lost brother and the answers to Wolfe\u2019s mysterious past.\n\nUNLIKELY ALLIES\nAlong the way you\u2019ll build a found family of colorful characters, each with their own thing going on. They might not all get along at first, but that\u2019s nothing a thrilling space adventure can\u2019t fix! And even with the trail gone cold, take heart, for these wandering stars are bound to find each other...\n\nAN ANIME YOU CAN PLAY\nInspired by anime the developers grew up watching, Wander Stars plays out across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d, each one taking between 60-90 minutes to complete. Each episode features a map to explore with procedurally generated battles, special events and other secrets to find along with the main story events.\nPlay an episode at a time, or binge the whole thing in one go! You can even replay episodes to find all the side adventures, NPCs, and party member banter you might have missed! Try new paths as you explore ever-changing maps with randomized special events, lurking rivals, and tantalizing treasures.

Instead you collect and enchant Arcana Constructs to grow your magical herb garden.\n\nIn a world where different traditions of magic live side by side, ambitious plans were made to open portals between worlds, but the ritual went terribly wrong. Those involved each lost something most precious to them and the portals became unstable, randomly spitting out new arrivals into the world.\n\nAfter falling through one of these mysterious portals yourself, you encounter the local witch Sage, who decides you\u2019re the best person to help her in her quest. Taken under her wing as an apprentice, you\u2019ll be able to help search for her missing Familiar, Flufferstoop.\n\nWith your cheeky Familiar Raven by your side, you\u2019ll gather the knowledge and ingredients to perform powerful rituals.

Fear not, that\u2019s why Arcana Constructs are there to do all your magical gardening for you! Using a mystical deck of cards, you\u2019ll be able to enchant them to plow, sow seeds, water and harvest them for you.

But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset. \n\nExperienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!\nTeams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!\n\nWAYS TO PLAY\nPlay solo or online. Be tethered together in local or online Co-Op. Race your friends in local Splitscreen. Enjoy the chaos of Fling to the Finish in a way that fits you.\n\nCOURSES!\nEvery course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next. \n\nATTACKS!\nOpponents battle back with hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers if they fall behind. Our items keep the races interesting, and help even the score if one player has more experience than another.  \n\nSHARE A CONTROLLER\nBecause you're literally attached to your partner, Fling to the Finish is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through Fling to the Finish by sharing a controller with your partner. \nThis control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","en","fr","de","pt"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086483,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000051000":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7a50fc3b553ddb4075e3d0fe0242107cbf76b60d47f27bb9c17221ba4483fc94.jpg","category":null,"description":null,"developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Ticket to Ride: Japan","nsuId":70050000051000,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Marmalade Game Studio","rating":0,"ratingContent":["Online Interactivity","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000053128":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1e1da244584fc4623f91ac451de009cbc583313dcfdb2dcbc10d0439f55ae786.jpg","category":null,"description":"\uff3c\uff3c Digital Bey Booster Vol.2\uff0f\uff0f\nIncludes 3 additional Beys that couldn't fit into the game!\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"BEYBLADE X XONE Digital Beybooster Vol.2","nsuId":70050000053128,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"FURYU Corporation","rating":0,"ratingContent":["In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000053129":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ec1827ca972cb0910d72694f6f2c80433c018d871f418a326a9b6a728fdd5cf3.jpg","category":null,"description":"Digital Beybooster Vol.3\nIncludes 3 additional Beys that couldn't fit into the game!\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\n\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"BEYBLADE X XONE Digital Beybooster Vol.3","nsuId":70050000053129,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"FURYU Corporation","rating":0,"ratingContent":["In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000058940":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b3dd110f649ad1efbeb4a094de96d0863dd175b2aa7595f4d03b6a3b5dc09db.jpg","category":null,"description":"The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds -
