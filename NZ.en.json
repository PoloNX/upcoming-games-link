Where will you stand?\n\nJoin one of two factions, each with their own values and in pursuit of their own goals. Your choice will be relevant for the rest of the game and impact the entire story. Everything comes with a price. Meet teachers and learn numerous abilities, but expect foes and betrayals too.\n\nForge your own path around dangerous landscapes, fulfill tasks, trade, gather and craft equipment. You start with nothing and as a nobody. Study your environment, and use the surrounding clues to reveal mysteries and grow stronger. Only your flow of battle stands between you and certain death.\n\nExplore nature and seal the power of spirits that rule it. Learn how to use them in your favor, but be prepared to battle their channeled anger in the world surrounding you.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/95012faed2ebfccbb4f8ca1f326f8e5b4013cf119ca99bbe0a61fb698f043ef1.jpg","id":"0100EF601B038000","intro":"Drova is an Action-RPG that marries the dark grim tones of its genre with the mysticism of Celtic mythology.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","de"],"name":"Drova - Forsaken Kin","nsuId":70010000065937,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Deck 13","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Coarse Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20241016,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/816659b6ee75b40da363407eea1713ce211810b5adb09a964aea7c7191732c63.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/965686e3e3a614e634002fe575e9449a24e085e0838ec4b836ff28d6d1b79613.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d3975e9c93f808b83adf7314c54fae564d998fa91a8933e1bda2a2e9652f506f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9b8fcc92d27ad4090bb461dcc75f0d1b05412f539a36ded6256d883248ddde0e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/edf43f18f6fce31283aefbe4a812ab002368a32530d866e50ea0ddc00d3ac8e7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c86aea94713e61a50bc0506ba9f48df5d160ba205c79da10515b7d9061138161.jpg"],"size":3705667584,"version":null},"70010000067709":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f908dcbf5f9d88a8475acb557f2ed465b332272c09323cfa9f27af8d5f3c2ff3.jpg","category":["Adventure","Platformer","Puzzle","Action"],"description":"Neva is an emotionally-charged action adventure from the visionary team behind the critically acclaimed GRIS.\n\nNeva chronicles the story of Alba, a young woman bound to a curious wolf cub following a traumatic encounter with dark forces.

Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist.\nThe knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.\n\n\u25a0Free-Form Scenario \nThe game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first\u2014from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey.\n\n\u25a0Combat \nThe strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!\n \n\u25a0Graphics \nThe original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.\n \n\u25a0Difficulty Settings \nSelect from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). \nCasual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.\n\n\u25a0Music & Voices \nKenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen.\nFurthermore, all event scenes now feature full Japanese and English voice acting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/85cd020706d10c0672fc1e3a7316774e44a78948514819ed95ef7ddbd0d6cc91.jpg","id":"010045301B86C000","intro":"Save Your Empire.

Help Morkull escape from the Ragast so he can rule the world and carry out his evil plans.\nYou know, typical clich\u00e9 villain stuff...\n\n\nArt and Animation\n\nMorkull Ragast's Rage is completely hand-drawn and animated frame-by-frame. Inspired and influenced by traditional animated films and other 2D video games, the old-school style gives life and fluidity of movement to the whole cast of characters.\n\nBreak the Fourth Wall\n\nWhat makes this game special is Morkull himself, his personality, and his ability to break the fourth wall to talk with the players like he was there in the room.\n\nMorkull possesses charisma and charm, and never fails to create a light-hearted atmosphere with his endless humor, bad jokes and pop culture references.\n\nCombat System\n\nYou'll have all the power of the God of Death and Darkness at your fingertips, of course, along with an ample selection of combos and abilities that will open up even the most remote corners of the Ragast.\n\nBecome Part of the Ragast and Join Our Community\n\nOnce you enter the Ragast, you'll never leave \u2013 unless you can get through Morkull\u2026 So why not join his ranks and support his Machiavellian cause with the rest of his champions as part of our Morkull Ragast's Rage community.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/baa3ee2b7e45527e2649781483b154b7d30a1d3fe1d540d7359f3c9d98091140.jpg","id":"01002B801D096000","intro":"Help Morkull escape this cursed Metroidvania video game!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es"],"name":"Morkull Ragast's Rage","nsuId":70010000072755,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Selecta Play","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Crude Humour"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250116,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e3507e32754bc973569a2bfaac5d6be4d1f901a3f4f24ce7a4adc935d92defb4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/dee5fd125a228b2f978d03030b5beb076cbb29bf65847b4ee3dacf349d83f0f8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8b068d4e1402f1c462fb259366812d963c485d12777e4a0508ce661ad69c693f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/21c9514c3548a7766206466555143892e30e282fb281c36043927c4a407351b4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/caba83a05ce07575c8887a1fd6fa8829ae0e5b82de7dc952fc1d8e299f8d78c7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9c4180ce068b159038cdf2732122c1d2536cc8384f809d4992b2d023d5dc7dbe.jpg"],"size":405798912,"version":null},"70010000084603":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cd75f9fb84fe60278ee53111b61997c1dc147d5a608c0dcd3342e6d50173ded8.jpg","category":["Platformer"],"description":"Help Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong recover their precious banana hoard from the villainous Tiki Tak Tribe in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD!

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mature Themes","Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250201,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70050000050585":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d0f8326f0ae3795f25a28f38618490c6915b2c89f89e7a6a73867a3bdf68947c.jpg","category":null,"description":"Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII: Deluxe Cosmetics Pack includes the following in-game content:\n\n4 profile customizations\nEmbellish your player profile in Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII with these cosmetic customizations, including a striking new badge, a regal new title, an ornate new banner, and an eye-catching new portrait that will all make you stand out from other players! \n\n1 alternate scout skin\nGive your scout recon unit a brand new look with this cosmetic outfit!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Build Something You Believe In","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII: Deluxe Cosmetics Pack","nsuId":70050000050585,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"2K Games","rating":8,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250206,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000050586":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e5188375f84d63f918b0fb41391f8db313222e93519b72481748912a08ba11.jpg","category":null,"description":"A leader persona in Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII offers a new variant of an existing leader, including a different outfit and background for that leader, new gameplay bonuses, and an alternative agenda that reflects a different side of their personality!

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
