This pixel-art puzzle puts you in control of a walking canvas that must cross hexagonal maps to reach the right painters. The atmosphere is charming and relaxing, with sound design tied to each painting action, creating a cozy and artistic experience.\n\nThe mechanics are easy to learn but full of possibilities: rotate and swap tiles to build the path, organize paint buckets, and make sure the canvas passes by the painters with the correct color. If you miss the sequence, the painting fails and the level is lost.\n\nThe color system is the heart of the game. Mix yellow, blue, and red, clean everything with white, or combine all three to create black. There are 6 possible variations, challenging you to plan the perfect path.\n\nWith 30 handcrafted levels, Paint Path starts in the Art Studio, where you learn the basics of painting and color logic.

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\n\nNow 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!\n\nThe original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian and Spanish.
