It is used during memorial services and placed on the Ihai (memorial tablet) in honor of the deceased. The Kaimyou represents the individual\u2019s spiritual journey and is usually bestowed by a Buddhist priest. The name often reflects the person\u2019s virtues or spiritual aspirations, and its creation follows specific religious customs. The use of Kaimyou is common in rituals surrounding death, mourning, and the afterlife, and it plays a significant role in the commemoration of ancestors.\n\nThis software automatically generates Kaimyou (posthumous Buddhist names).\n*Please note that while the term 'Kaimyou' is used as a general reference, in the app, the name may be referred to as 'Houmyou,' 'Hougou,' 'Myougou,' 'Okurina,' or other terms depending on the Buddhist sect.\n\nThis comprehensive Kaimyou editing tool is suitable not only for those who wish to receive a Kaimyou for themselves or their family members, but also for use by Buddhist priests. Additionally, since Japanese religions are tolerant, the app can be used by individuals from other religions without any issue. Even if you simply want a cool Kanji alias, you are welcome to use it.\n\n\n\nMain Features\n\n\u25a0 Automatic Kaimyou Generation\nBy simply answering questions and inputting the following profile information\u2014name, gender, age, sect, level of faith, occupation, hobbies, skills, and motto\u2014the Kaimyou will be automatically generated.\n\n\u25a0 Flexible Editing\nYou can freely modify the automatically generated Kaimyou. Changes can be made at the Kanji level while checking their meanings, allowing you to receive a Kaimyou that meets your preferences.\n\n\u25a0 Kaimyou Certificate Issuance\nOnce you have your favorite Kaimyou, you can issue a certificate. The certificate can be saved in an album, enabling you to transfer it to other devices or print it for use.\n\n\u25a0 As an Ihai\nBy switching your Nintendo Switch\u2122 to tabletop mode, it can be used as an Ihai. The Ihai is a memorial tablet that represents the deceased.\n\n\u25a0 Temple Member Management\nThe app includes a temple member management feature, allowing you to manage multiple individuals\u2019 names, ages, sects, and more. This makes it highly recommended for clergy who need to manage Kaimyou for multiple people.\n\n\u25a0 Supported Sects\n\u30fbJ\u014ddo-sh\u016b / SeizanJ\u014ddo-sh\u016b / J\u014ddoShin-sh\u016b / Shinsh\u016bTakada-Ha\n\u30fbNichiren-sh\u016b / NichirenSei-sh\u016b\n\u30fbS\u014dt\u014d-sh\u016b / Rinzai-sh\u016b / \u014cbaku-sh\u016b\n\u30fbShingon-sh\u016b / Tendai-sh\u016b / Y\u016bz\u016bNembutsu-sh\u016b\n\u30fbJi-sh\u016b\n\u30fbRitsu-sh\u016b\n\u30fbShinto\n\u30fbNo religion / Unknown\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/39a9db963f8ebe0b6260f6c19474befb36dc6adb4880b4188d33bdba3ced06d3.jpg","id":"01004AE0202EC000","intro":"This is a tool that automatically generates, manages, and edits Kaimyou.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mature Themes","Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250201,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70010000064410":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e8ca32d6b427ee11fdd4bf4ef44505c955f312491268cd35225c47b24fcd0c6c.jpg","category":["Action","Platformer","Puzzle","Adventure"],"description":"Teams of darsanauts got lost during their mining missions on the different moons of the planet Darsalon.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system.

Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
