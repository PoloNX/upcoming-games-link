But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset. \n\nExperienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!\nTeams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!\n\nWAYS TO PLAY\nPlay solo or online. Be tethered together in local or online Co-Op. Race your friends in local Splitscreen. Enjoy the chaos of Fling to the Finish in a way that fits you.\n\nCOURSES!\nEvery course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next. \n\nATTACKS!\nOpponents battle back with hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers if they fall behind. Our items keep the races interesting, and help even the score if one player has more experience than another.  \n\nSHARE A CONTROLLER\nBecause you're literally attached to your partner, Fling to the Finish is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through Fling to the Finish by sharing a controller with your partner. \nThis control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game.

A year after her defeat to Ordallia in the Fifty Years' War, the king succumbed to malady, leaving a mere boy of two to ascend the throne.\n\nWhoever was named regent would rule in truth, and thus emerged two rival candidates: dukes Goltanna and Larg, whose deeds during the war had earned them great renown. Goltanna the Black Lion and Larg the White Lion were destined to clash, and the resulting conflict would come to be known as the War of the Lions.\n\nAgainst this backdrop appear Ramza, third son of House Beoulve, one of Ivalice's leading military families, and his childhood companion Delita, a commoner raised amongst nobles. As they endeavor to chart a course through this tumultuous age, a mighty current draws them ever closer to the abyss.\n\n- Combat\nLead your party in exhilarating encounters where strategic positioning and forward planning determine the outcome. Use the varied terrain of 3D battlefields to your advantage, skillfully manipulate the turn order, and victory will be yours for the taking.\n\n- Character Growth and Customization\nCombine a wide variety of jobs and abilities to craft your very own strategies.\n\nAs your party members grow, they will gain access to more jobs, each with its own unique abilities. Once learned, abilities can be used even after changing to another job. With over 20 jobs to master\u2014including white mage, black mage, dragoon, and many others from the FINAL FANTASY series\u2014and hundreds of abilities to learn, you have the freedom to experiment and discover the combinations that best suit your party. Chocobos and other creatures can also be tamed and led into battle.\n\n- Two Versions: Enhanced and Classic\nWith improved graphics, fully voiced dialogue, and refined gameplay, the enhanced version provides the perfect way to immerse yourself in the world of Ivalice.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","en","fr","de","pt"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086483,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000051000":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7a50fc3b553ddb4075e3d0fe0242107cbf76b60d47f27bb9c17221ba4483fc94.jpg","category":null,"description":null,"developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Ticket to Ride: Japan","nsuId":70050000051000,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Marmalade Game Studio","rating":0,"ratingContent":["Online Interactivity","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000053128":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1e1da244584fc4623f91ac451de009cbc583313dcfdb2dcbc10d0439f55ae786.jpg","category":null,"description":"\uff3c\uff3c Digital Bey Booster Vol.2\uff0f\uff0f\nIncludes 3 additional Beys that couldn't fit into the game!\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"BEYBLADE X XONE Digital Beybooster Vol.2","nsuId":70050000053128,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"FURYU Corporation","rating":0,"ratingContent":["In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000053129":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ec1827ca972cb0910d72694f6f2c80433c018d871f418a326a9b6a728fdd5cf3.jpg","category":null,"description":"Digital Beybooster Vol.3\nIncludes 3 additional Beys that couldn't fit into the game!\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\u30fb????????\n\n\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"BEYBLADE X XONE Digital Beybooster Vol.3","nsuId":70050000053129,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"FURYU Corporation","rating":0,"ratingContent":["In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260101,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000058940":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b3dd110f649ad1efbeb4a094de96d0863dd175b2aa7595f4d03b6a3b5dc09db.jpg","category":null,"description":"The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds -
