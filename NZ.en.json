But when evil came to their world, they lost each other. Now both of them need to head towards each other, facing many difficulties and dangers along the way. And only by finding a fragile connection between one another and going hand in hand will they be able to defeat evil and meet again. It's a story about how we can help one another even when you're apart, and be far from one another even when you're nearby. It's a story about the importance of relationships and mutual support. But every story has an even deeper meaning...\n\nSPLIT SCREEN\nThe game works in splitscreen mode, with one character on each screen in their respective locations. The game has two modes. The first is single-player mode, where one player simultaneously controls both characters with one joystick. In this mode, the player must demonstrate sophisticated controller skills. The second is local co-op mode, where two players control the characters using two joysticks. Here, both players control their respective characters. Each mode has its advantages. Single-player mode requires you to show great dexterity and reaction speed, and co-op mode allows you to feel the joy of playing the game with your family or friend. Try both game modes, we hope you'll like it and enjoy completing it.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH AND HELP EACH OTHER\nEach character has their own part of the level in a common location. However, some parts of the level are interconnected. This means that the characters can interact and help each other complete the level. Characters can move keys and objects from one part of the screen to another, and most puzzles are need to be solved by both characters working together, connecting parts of the screen and solving puzzles together.\n\nEPIC BOSSES\nThe game has epic boss battles. Each boss represents the world of shadows that has invaded this fairytale forest and wants to plunge all the inhabitants of this fairytale world into the horror of eternal darkness. Our brave heroes, Lina and Minho, must defeat each of the bosses so that peace and prosperity will once again reign in the fairy forest. Boss battles take place without splitscreen, and are designed to be played by just one of the characters, so each character must defeat their evil shadow bosses.\n\nPUZZLES\nOn their way through the collapsing fairy-tale world, the characters will constantly encounter various puzzles like closed doors, laser beams with reflectors, ancient mechanisms and ruins, labyrinths, and caves full of dangers. Our heroes will be able to overcome all difficulties, but each will have to make every effort to pass these trials and help their companion.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/beefd17912b6e3c4b4f95387a73599e9cafa20bb4f0c8735b25b2c118a44abe8.jpg","id":"01002CB01CEE8000","intro":"Immerse yourself in the ethnic world of two heroes, solve puzzles and overcome obstacles together, explore the fairy forest and other locations, help each other.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","it","ru","zh"],"name":"Hand in Hand","nsuId":70010000072271,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"OverGamez","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Scary Scenes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240512,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f531cb8bcdf5dc5e8d09211dc8bb21fde5190fab37d3af30e8f1b7d246c4797b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/49d124826986ea1c28a9987ec7ba2a555707d0d6c5426ff2f0254ceb50c2e0ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4f8a382bbb12a540c98ce919f840f96f975ed77e020d006f699b0ed405c48dfc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f28ddbc10923154b3a7866bbabba0664894ecce5ed69e1258db3fbacc71c052d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4c4db6fd1fe4ecd9edb2f670846de0b9b9375f3979829aa3b8083664fca3b852.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2dc32626c6cecdf727446ae5a5159061fb1d73932836817424710cd69988f5a9.jpg"],"size":785383424,"version":null},"70010000076548":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/931e1a0d05a8db69508e8ec59ff3baec133efdfd1f9e1179f260f909b687b7c3.jpg","category":["Simulation","Action","Arcade","Shooter"],"description":"Prepare for an epic tower defense showdown as you defend your planet against waves of incoming robot invaders!

Lots and lots of monsters!\n\nMonster Outbreak is a pixel top-down survival game. Take control of Yulia, the last surviving member of the Royal Guard, and confront the endless monster hordes spawned by the out-of-control Dimensional Orb. Gear up, prepare defenses, lay down traps, cook a possible last meal, and try to stay alive.\n\nGo at it alone or enlist fellow survivors in  multiplayer! The last stand of the Royal Guard isn't over - until it's over.\n\n- Yulia has access to a broad range of weapons to be enchanted, from simple swords and axes to sophisticated bows providing elemental attacks, dealing additional damage and opening new ways of containing the endless waves of enemies.\n- Build up those defenses!

Everything that your tribe has built, tamed, and fought for has led to this final challenge. With your faithful artificial companion HLN-A by your side, you\u2019ve emerged from the Genesis simulation to find yourself aboard a gigantic starship being overtaken by a familiar threat from the distant past.\n\nIn Genesis Part 2, you\u2019ll explore a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills. Wielding an array of powerful new tames, items, weapons, and structures, you\u2019ll journey from idyllic fields through twilit phantasmagoric realms, all the way into a hellish heart of darkness. Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you\u2019ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time!\n\nNEW STORY-ORIENTED MISSIONS\nA holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of engaging new story-oriented missions at varying difficulty levels, as you build strength to confront Rockwell in a final battle for the ages. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover Explorer Notes and environmental cues along the way to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga.\n\nEXPANSIVE WORLDS TO CONQUER\nIn ARK: Genesis 2, you\u2019ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation.

He awakens in a new Tokyo, a wasteland ravaged by apocalypse now called Da\u2019at\u2026 but before bloodthirsty demons can claim his life, a savior emerges, and the two of them unite to become a mighty being, neither human nor demon: a Nahobino. \n\nWith newfound power, the protagonist ventures through Da'at, an enigmatic realm filled with mythical deities and demonic tyrants in constant conflict for survival.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
