Crystal Breaker is a vertically scrolling shmup that focuses on close range attack.\n\nStory\nIn the year 248 of the Space Era, an abnormality occurred in the defense system that supported human life. Unmanned weapons began destroying orbital industrial plants. The space government, which relied on computers, was powerless to do anything about the situation. Suddenly, an unknown fighter jet appeared, fighting against the unmanned weapons. The words CRYSTAL BREAKER were written on the side of the cockpit.\n\nOverall\nThis game is an aggressive shmup where close range attacks and quick destruction are important for both stage clear and score attacks.\n\nCrystal break by close range attack\nCrystals appear when you shoot an enemy at close range (Crystal Break). You can get bonuses by getting a certain number of crystals.\n\nActively overlap and attack the enemy\nYou will not receive damage even if you come into contact with the enemy body. It is effective to quickly approach the enemies that appear and destroy them by overlapping them.\n\nMove fast with boost\nYou can move at high speed by pressing the boost button. You can quickly approach and destroy enemies or avoid enemy sniper bullets by moving fast.\n\nThe player can be selected from two players with different abilities\nYou can choose from two types: standard type and short range power type.\n\nScore attack for each stage\nThere are multiple stages, and by clearing a stage, the next stage will be released.

Snow Bros. Wonderland is the newest chapter\u2014and boy, has a lot changed in the last couple of decades! For starters, the graphics aren\u2019t two-dimensional anymore; the new game offers a gorgeous 3D isometric style. Armed with an endless supply of ice pellets, gamers can turn monsters into snowballs, which can be kicked to destroy whole hordes of foes! Attacks can be chained to take down multiple enemies at once, and your snowball skills will be put to the ultimate test against some truly massive bosses. Are you (snow)man enough to defend Snow Land from evil King Atchich?\n\nFOUR TIMES THE FUN\nPreviously, Snow Bros. was always a two-player game (which makes perfect sense given the name), but this time, the number of players has doubled! Now, you can have up to four players at once, making the adventure even more fun to experience. After all, shared joy is double the joy, and quadrupled joy is even better! Oh, and did you know that you can also customize your snowy avatar with hats, goggles, scarves, and all kinds of fun stuff? Find your own style!\n\nTHE HISTORY OF SNOW BROS\nThe first game in the chilly, snowy Snow Bros. saga was released in 1990, featuring two snowman brothers, Nick and Tom, who rolled snowballs, jumped on platforms, and defeated enemies in a quest to rescue the princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi. Four years later, the sequel, Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves\u2014a game as quirky and bizarre as it was wonderfully entertaining\u2014was released. But despite the love for the first two Snow Bros. games, we haven\u2019t had a true third entry in the series. Until now.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mature Themes","Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250201,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70050000050585":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d0f8326f0ae3795f25a28f38618490c6915b2c89f89e7a6a73867a3bdf68947c.jpg","category":null,"description":"Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII: Deluxe Cosmetics Pack includes the following in-game content:\n\n4 profile customizations\nEmbellish your player profile in Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII with these cosmetic customizations, including a striking new badge, a regal new title, an ornate new banner, and an eye-catching new portrait that will all make you stand out from other players! \n\n1 alternate scout skin\nGive your scout recon unit a brand new look with this cosmetic outfit!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Build Something You Believe In","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII: Deluxe Cosmetics Pack","nsuId":70050000050585,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"2K Games","rating":8,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250206,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000050586":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e5188375f84d63f918b0fb41391f8db313222e93519b72481748912a08ba11.jpg","category":null,"description":"A leader persona in Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII offers a new variant of an existing leader, including a different outfit and background for that leader, new gameplay bonuses, and an alternative agenda that reflects a different side of their personality!

It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
