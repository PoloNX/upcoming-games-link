It is used during memorial services and placed on the Ihai (memorial tablet) in honor of the deceased. The Kaimyou represents the individual\u2019s spiritual journey and is usually bestowed by a Buddhist priest. The name often reflects the person\u2019s virtues or spiritual aspirations, and its creation follows specific religious customs. The use of Kaimyou is common in rituals surrounding death, mourning, and the afterlife, and it plays a significant role in the commemoration of ancestors.\n\nThis software automatically generates Kaimyou (posthumous Buddhist names).\n*Please note that while the term 'Kaimyou' is used as a general reference, in the app, the name may be referred to as 'Houmyou,' 'Hougou,' 'Myougou,' 'Okurina,' or other terms depending on the Buddhist sect.\n\nThis comprehensive Kaimyou editing tool is suitable not only for those who wish to receive a Kaimyou for themselves or their family members, but also for use by Buddhist priests. Additionally, since Japanese religions are tolerant, the app can be used by individuals from other religions without any issue. Even if you simply want a cool Kanji alias, you are welcome to use it.\n\n\n\nMain Features\n\n\u25a0 Automatic Kaimyou Generation\nBy simply answering questions and inputting the following profile information\u2014name, gender, age, sect, level of faith, occupation, hobbies, skills, and motto\u2014the Kaimyou will be automatically generated.\n\n\u25a0 Flexible Editing\nYou can freely modify the automatically generated Kaimyou. Changes can be made at the Kanji level while checking their meanings, allowing you to receive a Kaimyou that meets your preferences.\n\n\u25a0 Kaimyou Certificate Issuance\nOnce you have your favorite Kaimyou, you can issue a certificate. The certificate can be saved in an album, enabling you to transfer it to other devices or print it for use.\n\n\u25a0 As an Ihai\nBy switching your Nintendo Switch\u2122 to tabletop mode, it can be used as an Ihai.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mature Themes","Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250201,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70010000082747":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/31090b492494ae8ebd2e475b550abd4b486f3f54530f7a336ce6de440c8f5ef5.jpg","category":["Adventure","RPG"],"description":"The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022\u2019s most acclaimed RPGs!\n\nYou are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body. You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.\n\nPUSH YOUR LUCK\nEach character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success.\n\nNAVIGATE THE BELT\nChart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Starward Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.\n\nDO THE JOB, GET PAID\nContracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FUTURE\nPlayer choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/efb3c6044459819a30ca308e2b3329c1a036ed0b9cf8d66b620cf42bd3541c71.jpg","id":"0100B4001F81C000","intro":"A DICE DRIVEN RPG","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector","nsuId":70010000082747,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Fellow Traveller","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild Coarse Language","Mild Drug References","Mild Themes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250201,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/37122921fb7e539387a6dfdbe5e762de66351cc6119a87f6dc7c0fe963947be8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3f733b94db8c3b21124b61897e38543453a79b1bc24bd1e883d4631d4fe8112c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/165ddc1c5aff50e413f7e6e3a53da661f643d0ba374ef8ddbe46461aa7b174ce.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4a25dc42335abc9cb54a30c69b8d428824ebba5ff079d558cce9735c0cf9d011.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c5245bd72442d480208197ed82a063e41949ff247585e57ef95e135ac9398a64.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e0feaac95f280674eace09b1b076dbb01e696bc4862e5a13cbf2bef123f5c0b4.jpg"],"size":632291328,"version":null},"70010000064410":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e8ca32d6b427ee11fdd4bf4ef44505c955f312491268cd35225c47b24fcd0c6c.jpg","category":["Action","Platformer","Puzzle","Adventure"],"description":"Teams of darsanauts got lost during their mining missions on the different moons of the planet Darsalon.
