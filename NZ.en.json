    "description": "Inspired By the Classics, Made for the 21st Century\nChallenging platform parkour inspired by classic SEGA games of the 90s - The Jungle Book, Aladdin, Lion King \u2013 but with modern twists and ideas. Platform parkour through the remains of humanity. Outwit evolved wildlife and dangerous hybrid flora. Crack environmental puzzles that keep you guessing. And stay one step ahead of the wicked humans who are pursuing you in a twisted apocalyptic safari hunt.\n\nThe Story of a Hunted Cub\nAfter the Great Ecological Catastrophe, the ultrarich flee to Mars and leave the rest to perish. But among them a small child who developed immunity to the hostile planet remains. Decades pass and those on Mars venture back to Earth to do recon. When they spot a small human child, The Cub, they immediately try to capture it. This sets off a journey of escape, exploration and discovery through the urban ruins of humanity coupled with frantic cat and mouse chases.\n\nThis World Tells Tales\nExplore the ruins of humanity after the Great Ecological Catastrophe wipes out most of the civilization and leaves our remains to be reclaimed by an evolved mother nature. The story and clues of how and why humanity fell is strewn throughout the world. Crumbling brutalist tower blocks and abandoned genetics labs. Depleted chemical mines and overgrown battlefields. Each level has a story to tell.\n\nThe Perfect Tunes to Keep You Company\nAccompanying you on the journey is Radio Nostalgia From Mars, a custom soundtrack that\u2019ll crash land into your psyche. Sink into thought-provoking survivor stories from the few ultrarich living on Mars, while a smooth-voiced radio DJ keeps the show moving with a collection of chill apocalypse-wave tunes.\n\nIf Looks Could Bring Back Memories\nMeticulously drawn and stylized to look like the classic animated films of the late 90s - Atlantis, Tarzan, Road to El Dorado - while also taking a page from Samurai Jack\u2019s creator Genndy Tartakovsky critically acclaimed series, Primal.",

However, there is hope for the republic of Silverhead, and you are the only one who can save it. Take control of the Striker airplane or Zeppelin with an aerial mine launcher and engage in intense euro-shmup action, battling enemies both in the air and on the ground, and using devastating screen-clearing attacks in tight spots. With improved graphics and controls, Steel Empire, originally released in the early 90s for a 16-bit console, has been ported to various handheld consoles.

It's every pirate for themselves in a back-stabbing, treasure-grabbing struggle, and only one may live...\n\nBullion: The Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle is a local multiplayer brawler for up to four players, featuring a cast of backstabbing bovine buccaneers and a unique blend of PvP and co-op gameplay.\n\nStranded on the Islands of Ser-Lloyn, the heathen gods have declared that only the one bringing the greatest offering of treasure shall live - so each pirate must grab as much loot as they can! Even death will not deny the gods their game; fallen pirates become ghosts and can return to life at their gravestones. However... should the entire crew fall at the same time then the game ends with no winner - so players must balance working together in order to keep at least one crewmember alive with doing whatever it takes in order to have the most treasure at the end of the battle! Unlock the secrets, voyage across the islands and battle titanic champions in an attempt to defy the gods and attempt to survive the Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle!",

Unleash your skills across these diverse landscapes, transforming them into manicured canvases with the rhythmic hum of your trusty mowing blades.\n\nREAL-WORLD LICENSED MOWER BRANDS\nThe original licensed lawn mower brands of Toro, SCAG, STIGA, and EGO have been re-created in a visually and physically stunning way.
