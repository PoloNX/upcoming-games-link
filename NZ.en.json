Created in a hand-drawn and collage art style reminiscent of cozy picture books, it presents a harbor populated with surprising creatures such as the scrapcrabs and the bobcat kittens, but also yummy \u201cmousemallows\u201d. \n\nThe SOLO adventure is suitable for young children on their own thanks to specific accessibility features. It doesn\u2019t require knowing how to read and can be played with a touch screen. With short gameplay stages that enable trial and error, Mouse & Crane befits different skill and experience levels.\nIn this mode, players control Crane\u2019s arm. They start with just a hook to transport things like containers or Mouse himself, and progressively discover various upgrades such as a giant magnet to grab metal scraps and tools, or a wrecking ball for the most satisfying demolitions!\n\nMouse & Crane also shines in CO-OP with the child and parent (or an older sibling) working creatively together to solve puzzles that can't be completed alone, sharing digital moments. In this mode, one player plays as Crane while the other can make Electryna move and jump with fun motion controls, helping Mouse get new tools... Electryna\u2019s swiftness and electric powers are a delight. \n\nThe game is produced by two studios from Denmark and Canada that are experienced in creating meaningful and wholesome experiences for children. Mouse & Crane shows the power of cooperation, creativity, upcycling and DIY crafting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/edebd27aec7891069ed63eea7d40cca030da96448656e9da56f491653a8c93a2.jpg","id":"010053B01F3F4000","intro":"Ideal as a child\u2019s first game, Mouse & Crane is a single or multiplayer adventure offering creative puzzle-solving moments through cooperation, upcycling and construction.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","fr"],"name":"Mouse & Crane","nsuId":70010000081606,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Those Eyes","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240621,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80313b5718caa9689f6784baa1e9939bde5d156405ebf5af158a53288f6a3eef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e71e9873c7c6bf6cf72a09ff0bcf89a1116625c3ce5fc402ee972030229608a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8ae08d6ff3261ac3b415fa359840e416a02d716617ed12adff48777bcb84b61b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2beae13defe99ee9ce700941dd2e72a750ab63c3534cc60c37c51d1463c5a0de.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/235fb000bb0be96019cd24cded7dcea3686b60d7fa155e98484970b7e565d717.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc99a435a31b4b8387c1a0021521935b3cfee1b513a6a405e9c4d80725ac044a.jpg"],"size":776994816,"version":null},"70010000081625":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8a3c787ef6c7a922be3d846a2ea883f9a0c2e7e1ab95458373d8c4fd688c6a41.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure"],"description":"Run, collide with enemies, and enjoy the exhilarating action of spinning them around.\n\nIt features various actions using the floor, such as lifting the floor, throwing it, using it as a shield, gliding, cutting grass, walking on the surface of the water, and placing mines.\nAlso, the way to defeat bosses is a little different.\n\nItems can be used to enhance the player and extend the scope of exploration.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/65c08f1ced639d5cfe31b8c3a99513277272ec2b2d42eb22b6ad9e3944f38948.jpg","id":"01007DA01F060000","intro":"This is an action game to reclaim the lost colors of creatures.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en"],"name":"Pixel World: Unity-Chan!","nsuId":70010000081625,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"G2PLHAS","rating":0,"ratingContent":["Very Mild Coarse Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240621,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3a24d936d9c7a002f0ca5cc69833e0115f0a1972642a9e7329747a259a0e47fe.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2d484451fd9c1633fb9fd6a654b3036a2975777079ac4cde4a5de541a133f560.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/368085aaa3ff2c26a4a75bc5d88c8e43dc639326895bec9cf114a7344b927b1f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/32e1e7529ec82f9d2f4e3d3fae95d4e671b45ca9da58753bd1400cf0a391a0de.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a5c3c5c66adf88bf9638ae42fdf9c85dccbda06e0116be4232225b3a01febfe5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ac4f9b6f61fe02ba803a35ab821624effd2ecfba9e9a53aa520670e37172754d.jpg"],"size":489684992,"version":null},"70010000082105":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/38f88b3662edc2a9eb9c26e7411a009a19b0c825d9d7c4f4d77acb129830a114.jpg","category":["Action","RPG","Adventure"],"description":"Released in Japan by SEIN SOFT in 1985, this side-scrolling action RPG follows the adventures of the brave warrior Tritorn. Players take control of Tritorn as he battles numerous monsters to restore peace to the island of Luwanda, which is under the control of the tyrant Pay-Valusa.\n\nTritorn primarily fights using jumps and sword strikes. By anticipating the enemy's movements, he will swing his sword, and executing a sword strike from a jump inflicts double damage, showcasing an advanced technique. Furthermore, as Tritorn grows, he learns magic, allowing him to halt enemy movements or instantly eliminate them. \n\nWhile the game is an action RPG, it's not just about defeating enemies. There are puzzle-solving elements incorporated, where defeating specific enemies in consecutively rewards players with items. Some puzzles may be challenging, but they add depth to the gameplay.\n\nWith its fast-paced action, skill-based combat, engaging puzzles, and the ability to learn three different magic spells as Tritorn grows, this game offers a rich experience for action RPG enthusiasts. Even those new to the genre are encouraged to give this a try.\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/149f13738ffa1a830ca45b54357e5b30fd62dad72fb7e3f19e56e0c9602d1a73.jpg","id":"010025C01F618000","intro":"Tritorn, a brave warrior, stands up to restore peace to the island of Luwanda.

Just like using enemies as projectiles, flinging your buddy against the enemies could be a good strategy. But be careful, as you won't only stun the enemy you hit but your buddy-turned projectile as well.

Aside from the usual responsibilities of a headmaster, you are also tasked with managing various issues that originate outside the school, including mysterious dangers and potential threats that might cause things to go bananas!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1375ca4ed00529dbb937f9162d7306ee00eadd3f381c69f9d62caa75196d5344.jpg","id":"0100F4C01EBC6000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","fr","de","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Let's School","nsuId":70010000079866,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PM Studios","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240716,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5f28f3da111201f968fa7968f346fb314254bdc73eabfeeba951fcef8c0a078f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9c9b6d1b9246720a06bbe0c7ccd1bbfa5ec298587694ef7ef114ea06f9524285.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bcaba30f0fcdc72de2393e5084b70ab15cf49379caea539b075451b25950cac2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fa9e2f42e51e6b71f08db299037cfc7da1230cb20e0277f3d716f673e3caefdf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1d31f72b234f6c07984521f4cd55a21e2c2edc3a6ae31d3598c4da48bfe3ae4a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6bf2409bb4fc84f80a3c7f6f40a50f09985d5b450b85f2fa64cc34781b814757.jpg"],"size":487587840,"version":null},"70010000078298":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a9bbd2cd20e788ba269dd2a9deaf50751b922b080f698b0a1ad8db2d3304924b.jpg","category":["Racing","Multiplayer","Party","Arcade"],"description":"Hot Lap Racing offers a thrilling \"\"simcade\"\" racing experience driven by an in-house physics engine built exclusively for the game.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
