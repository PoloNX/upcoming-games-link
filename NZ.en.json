Viceroys building settlements among the scraggly rocks will find themselves reliant on black market traders while mining the basalt columns that grow here in place of trees.\n\nThose seeking more verdant fields will find suitable sites among the Bamboo Flats instead. Though lush with life, the heavy rainfall erodes the loose soil, and settlers must work carefully to appease a peculiar species local to the ecosystem if they want any chance at success: the Fluffbeak.

But be warned \u2013 these criminals will quickly turn from merchants to miscreants, and while they present an excellent opportunity, they also expect debts to be paid in a timely manner.\n- Settle the Bamboo Flats biome with the help of an unlikely ally \u2013 though the constant rain has left these regions devoid of fertile soil, the giant Fluffbeak, if kept happy,  is able to produce copious amounts of fertilizer to help create areas of fertile soil and establish a flourishing settlement.\n- 3 new World Map Modifiers will bring harsher lands to conquer. From the Riverlands and their minimal space to places of great significance for the ancients, still watched by silent guardians that limit the number of Cornerstones that can be used.\n- 3 new World Events introduce an increasingly powerful criminal organization, explosive alchemical experiments that threaten your carefully laid-out plans, and a tree-eating beast that inadvertently opens glades and unleashes the secrets hidden within them, whether you\u2019re ready or not.\n- 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 16 new Deeds, and 6 new Decorations have been added alongside new rewards to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Bats as a playable species, you must reach level 11.\n\nPunish the meek and push forth into harsher lands in service of the Scorched Queen \u2013 with the Bats by your side, there is little room for the weak-willed.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Against the Storm - Nightwatchers","nsuId":70050000061909,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild fantasy themes","In-game purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251205,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4a8e6a5f9ae70c810c16320832a0b0c34a756c380a346c8ebb10d20b189b3ec0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/41733e34d8c37ce0f70004eb02623452c830e32980404237225245176f3f1cd7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/696dfd68644243065e7838c9288a018ec76399458147b0b0235773fb5d24b1a3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/563c33ddb4697963ed21c17f9f92bc3ecf8ea91dd4e1edbdac4efd46708a12b2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/21a22793e82222f2b06638047cbbc66de9bdd659cb884db1f478a5e1793c7d4b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4680e84e28b9e119873419958c15e84d150095864297f842f6236642db913c06.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70050000064848":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/595f61b32d6ba7c02b1b1670104c5ba8e7b5d7390be885abe0352050f7144ee9.jpg","category":null,"description":"A set of christmas-themed stickers to embellish a sticker album.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Christmas Pack","nsuId":70050000064848,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Trefl S.A","rating":0,"ratingContent":["General"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251205,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/61ad4724e890a32ca285066aca3d2a53729d3cfe9cbc3f3a7ede8537215f24fa.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c49a61075977016cb667e11722ad20ba59f28696e3cbe22c50aa380385b6a1b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1117751e829721ef073abfdd081b7b0b4a7fa137072de626d2e5528ce32626d4.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70070000031295":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/344041ee39bc2b88007e6368e177453e0a533447bb60b21584914638fd197193.jpg","category":null,"description":"Cook tons of delicious meals from all over the world and become the best chef in the city!\n\nCook hundreds of tasty dishes with all the possible kitchen appliances and countless ingredients! \nTry it all: coffee makers, juice machines, pizza ovens, frying pans, fryers and ice cream machines. \n\nUpgrade and decorate your restaurants to attract more clients. \n\nUpgrade your kitchen appliances and ingredients to cook tasty dishes faster and earn more money!\n\nThis comprehensive collection includes three great cooking games: Food Truck Tycoon, Burger Chef Tycoon, Pizza Bar Tycoon!\n\nFeatures:\n* More than 100 dishes to serve \n* 3 unique locations\n* More than 200 levels to explore\n* Countless upgrades\n* Unlock new items to upgrade your kitchen appliances, interiors and ingredients\n* 100+ achievements to gain\n\nThis bundle includes Cooking Tycoons - 3 in 1 Bundle, Food Truck Tycoon Multiplayer Mode, Food Truck Tycoon New Levels #1, Pizza Bar Tycoon New Levels #1, Pizza Bar Tycoon New Levels #2 and Pizza Bar Tycoon Multiplayer Mode with:\n\n- Food Truck Tycoon local multiplayer gameplay mode\n- 45 brand new levels for Food Truck Tycoon\n- Pizza Bar Tycoon local multiplayer gameplay mode\n- 40 brand new levels for Pizza Bar Tycoon\n\nNOTE: to play the Multiplayer Mode DLC, each player will need their own set of Joy-Con\u2122 or an additional Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller.

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\n\nNow 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!\n\nThe original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability.
