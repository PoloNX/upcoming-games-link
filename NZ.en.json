In Cafe Owner Simulator you have such an opportunity, our goal is to give the world a game - in which everyone can realize his dream and open his own restaurant business.\n\nCleaning and Restoration.\nWhen you buy a room for your own restaurant - you will need to free it from trash and make major repairs, it is not an easy task, but what can be better than to clean up the future of a successful restaurant or cafe?\n\nCovering Surfaces.\nAfter cleaning and repairing - you will have to choose the best wallpaper, carpet or coverings of different materials, this is where your design will begin.\n\nKitchen and equipment.\nSo how do you do without kitchen equipment? Decide on the type of your future establishment and buy all the necessary equipment for it. Also, do not forget to connect it to the outlets.\n\nMenu and products\nTo open a place - you need to add a minimum of 5 dishes to the menu.\nTo prepare these dishes - you'll need products, you can buy them at the grocery store.\n\nManagement and employees\nThe game has a job market. To hire a staff member, pay a headhunter and he will find a marketable staff member for you. Every worker has his own characteristics, so choose the best ones.\nThe higher the characteristics - the higher the salary the worker wants. Over time, the motivation to work decreases - pay bonuses or hire new workers, here the choice is yours.\n\nDevelopment of the restaurant, levels\nFor performing various actions in the game - you earn experience points.\nWhen you reach a certain limit - the level grows and you get a lot of opportunities:\nnew furniture and equipment to set up, new dishes on the menu, new features on your tablet, cash rewards and more.\n\nRestaurant expansion and new features\nEarning money - you will be able to open new areas of your cafe to make all your design ideas come true. In the future it will be possible to build a hotel near the restaurant and create a square for recreation and entertainment of visitors.\n\nDuties of a restaurant owner\nLike any owner or manager of a restaurant business - there is a lot of work and daily tasks waiting for you. Paying bills, managing employees, ordering food, checking the condition of the equipment and its repair, controlling various pests and cleaning the premises, working at the cash register and at the cafe counter (until you hire employees for this), passing inspections by the fire inspector, setting up and ordering advertising, marketing, if necessary you can take a loan from the bank, but it is better to pay back in time, otherwise there will be problems, and much more.",

They quickly learn things aren't going to be as easy as they hoped. With a powerful army and a mysterious rumour both on the rise, Chorus needs to discover how they can protect the ones they love - before it's too late.\n\nExplore a beautiful, atmospheric land and fight monsters on your journey to find your place in the world. \n\nFEAUTRES:\n-Friends and foes brought to life in expressive hand-drawn 2D animation!\n-Talk to lots of cute and strange characters as you explore the land of Salia!\n-Explore five unique areas filled with their own special enemies, villages, and bosses! \n-Upgrade your blade at the blacksmith's shop for stronger attacks!\n-Follow a heartfelt story that deals with themes of identity and self love!\n-Try to make the world just a little bit better!

Platform parkour through the remains of humanity. Outwit evolved wildlife and dangerous hybrid flora. Crack environmental puzzles that keep you guessing. And stay one step ahead of the wicked humans who are pursuing you in a twisted apocalyptic safari hunt.\n\nThe Story of a Hunted Cub\nAfter the Great Ecological Catastrophe, the ultrarich flee to Mars and leave the rest to perish. But among them a small child who developed immunity to the hostile planet remains. Decades pass and those on Mars venture back to Earth to do recon. When they spot a small human child, The Cub, they immediately try to capture it. This sets off a journey of escape, exploration and discovery through the urban ruins of humanity coupled with frantic cat and mouse chases.\n\nThis World Tells Tales\nExplore the ruins of humanity after the Great Ecological Catastrophe wipes out most of the civilization and leaves our remains to be reclaimed by an evolved mother nature. The story and clues of how and why humanity fell is strewn throughout the world. Crumbling brutalist tower blocks and abandoned genetics labs. Depleted chemical mines and overgrown battlefields. Each level has a story to tell.\n\nThe Perfect Tunes to Keep You Company\nAccompanying you on the journey is Radio Nostalgia From Mars, a custom soundtrack that\u2019ll crash land into your psyche. Sink into thought-provoking survivor stories from the few ultrarich living on Mars, while a smooth-voiced radio DJ keeps the show moving with a collection of chill apocalypse-wave tunes.\n\nIf Looks Could Bring Back Memories\nMeticulously drawn and stylized to look like the classic animated films of the late 90s - Atlantis, Tarzan, Road to El Dorado - while also taking a page from Samurai Jack\u2019s creator Genndy Tartakovsky critically acclaimed series, Primal.",

Even death will not deny the gods their game; fallen pirates become ghosts and can return to life at their gravestones. However... should the entire crew fall at the same time then the game ends with no winner - so players must balance working together in order to keep at least one crewmember alive with doing whatever it takes in order to have the most treasure at the end of the battle! Unlock the secrets, voyage across the islands and battle titanic champions in an attempt to defy the gods and attempt to survive the Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle!",
