Every move matters, and success depends on strategy and planning. You can discard tiles that don't fit your plan, but this reduces your pool of available tiles. To refresh it, you must fill tiles by guiding paths through them six times, deepening the mechanics further.\n\nSound is an integral part of Oxytone, so I recommend playing with headphones.

Small disclaimer: there might be some missing rails sections. And occasional barbarian attacks. But don\u2019t worry, our trains are the most reliable out there. Some just require a few upgrades here and there. Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you!\nDid we mention wildfires?\n\nTrackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way.\n\nThe game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists.\n\nGATHER RESOURCES\nThere aren't many resources in the desert, so you\u2019ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way.\n\nUNLOCK BLUEPRINTS\nYou\u2019ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, it\u2019s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely.\n\nBUILD\nWith enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key.\n\nDEFEND\nAttacks are frequent. You\u2019ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, you\u2019ll have to be more creative with how you use them.\n\nKEEP THE TRAIN GOING\nFeed your train with fuel, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything. Try to automate things to keep moving as the game gets harder and harder with time and distance.\n\nFEATURES\n- High replayability value\n- Many items to gather and craft\n- Multiple game modes\n- Mini quests to complete\n- Random deterministic map generator","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8a14f6a207f6d8acbb157c58be888701450234566f216dad3053b97e3870ab59.jpg","id":"0100AD801E6F8000","intro":"Embark on a thrilling journey through an unforgiving desert.

Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last.\n\nChoose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Take advantage of a sophisticated skill system to determine which strengths your climber should have.\n\nIn the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events.\n\nThree mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought.\n\nFace the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.\n\nKeyfeatures\n-no two climbs are alike\n-procedurally generated mountains\n-dynamic world with different weather effects\n-hundreds of events with ever-changing outcomes\n-strategic gameplay in path finding, stat and equipment management\n-3 characters with different abilities","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b82c8f32100cf396e41a1dd932e4357fc696dada854eb8f48da738941414e827.jpg","id":"010090C01AC4A000","intro":"Death always climbs with you","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","pt","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Insurmountable","nsuId":70010000065071,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild Themes","Mild Violence","Scary Scenes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240425,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/28325464f467c935fe9e153c3363963b9551446c7e75d52c47ecc7ea5c9f8e05.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e580a99940273724e10cf25695c4ffdf139bd8fd09b912dc577806600efb7cf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/573c4df95278f70c9234e1eca5ef54b94537ac08906904a42b9f2837d3311bb6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d52c2750e0642b1c5c8a94140bd13c7b2c0426419fa79febda7e49875e760fd4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cdec9d58ef397ed68c82e43ed6c5ed23e380f566a2c01ba58a429e5a6e0fb0bb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/172b5c69022ff04568df5d590b37d446f601e71c44e3a70b785883a6086849cb.jpg"],"size":744488960,"version":null},"70010000077232":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/30d271d2b440b66a04ff7848e67e69349dcef25370a71905029aff6e2699ab2d.jpg","category":["RPG"],"description":"The latest standalone entry in the SaGa franchise, SaGa Emerald Beyond, brings together the very best elements of the beloved series to offer each player their own unique gameplay experience.\n \nMake use of glimmers and combos in battle; meet a diverse cast of races, including monsters, mechs, and vampires; and experience your very own story, created through your choices and actions.\n \nDistant Worlds Woven Together:\nTravel to 17 unique worlds from the Junction, either led by the hand of destiny or by a path forged by your own choices.\nDiscover the completely different cultures and landscapes, ranging from a densely developed forest of skyscrapers and a green and luscious habitat covered in plant life to a world governed by five witches, or one ruled by vampires - just to name a few of the distinct settings.\n \nAn Eclectic Cast of Protagonists:\nSix leading characters, all from diverse backgrounds and with vastly different goals, set out on their journey in five unique story arcs. \nThey venture to the myriad of worlds for their very own personal reasons: One, a human on a mission to protect the barrier defending his city; another, a witch trying to regain her lost magic while maintaining her disguise as a schoolgirl; and yet another, a vampire lord out to regain his crown and reclaim the throne as the rightful king of his world. \nEven selecting the same protagonist for a second--or third or fourth--playthrough will lead to completely new events and stories, a completely fresh path and experience.\n \nA Story of Your Very Own Making:\nSaGa Emerald Beyond has the greatest number of branching plots of any game in the SaGa series. \nThe story branches abundantly depending on your choices and actions.
