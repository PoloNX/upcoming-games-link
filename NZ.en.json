Once, everything was born, flourished, and perished there\u2014even the gods were no exception, it is said. The tale of EA=Rune Worth, which is about to be told, begins with the birth of the absolute god, Eatils. Yet, even this is only a small fragment of the many stories that should be told in Rune Worth...\n\nThis action RPG was released in 1989. Players take on the role of a young traveler, journeying through the world of Rune Worth, gradually becoming entangled in a grand adventure. At first glance, it may seem like a conventional action RPG, but it is packed with unique features.\n\nFor example, level-ups occur through events and items, meaning battles with enemies can be kept to a minimum, allowing players to purely enjoy the story. Spells require casting time, and if the player is attacked during casting, the spell is interrupted. Even small actions, such as opening treasure chests or crouching, have dedicated character animations. These elements come together to create a distinctive RPG experience.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1649eeec32daf02a99c549b85de983bafc97215e6af5e6c7f06adce6b3c338d4.jpg","id":"010070C0234C4000","intro":"Embark on an epic adventure set in the world of Rune Worth.

But is this all real, or just another show gimmick to raise audience ratings?\n\nAmerican Arcadia combines two gameplay styles, a 2.5D platformer and a first-person puzzle game, to reveal a unique story in a thrilling single player experience.\n\nUncover the truth and escape with your life in American Arcadia! \n \nESCAPE FROM A 70'S TELEVISED UTOPIA\nThe gripping story will be presented as a documentary with interviews and police interrogations of the characters as you progress through the game.\n\nTWO EXPERIENCES, ONE GAME\nAmerican Arcadia gives you control over two characters in completely different environments and unique playstyles: A 2.5D action side-scroller including challenging platform action, breath-taking chases, stealth and puzzles. As well as a full 3D first-person game, with hacking, exploration, stealth elements, and more puzzles to solve.\n\nIMPRESSIVE VOICE CAST\nYuri Lowenthal (Spider-Man 1 & 2, Prince of Persia The Sands of Time, Call of the Sea), Krizia Bajos (Cyberpunk 2077, League of Legends) and Cissy Jones (Firewatch, Life is Strange, Call of the Sea), among others, breathe life into the characters in American Arcadia.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4941790c9e1c650173e992ca1ae273b96bbd9e40078a3b5be13c8a675b8a6500.jpg","id":"01003A70209AE000","intro":"Welcome to Arcadia!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","ru","ko","zh"],"name":"American Arcadia","nsuId":70010000087158,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Raw Fury","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Coarse Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250516,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a14316fd2f9f0c1207065a9e5f901958cd4724c722555a2a7757c40cbe43e54e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/83ce9c526fc63c51d765ffddf5ca7a23ffcdbe0628cbe9045237c1b40a055b90.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5fdcdc83976b3f900e37b907b8e7e8e49ee57260dfde1be1f3b5098f33fec749.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ccc6d23ba6f27f4228d799635a360c03009333e8ffbe99cb2407adc86bff24d5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/688f9eaa664cb10514f2dfaa08b5d8c5416a3445a06fa803ebe22acedf657171.jpg"],"size":5014290432,"version":null},"70010000087632":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2c53bfb44772a2181f00660e627092763479561ffd35bd9d637aff0802670140.jpg","category":["Adventure"],"description":"The remote town of Okunezato is shaped like a crescent moon and shrouded in dark myths and legends. \n\nTake on the role of a brave young woman journeying into the unknown to uncover dangerous truths and locate her missing brother with her childhood friend. \n\nThey find the area rife with mystery and populated by intriguing characters, each harboring their own hidden motivations. \n\nEncounter heart-racing twists and turns as you dig deeper into the story.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aacacbf6ccc5675c765bd9709e83f1c76e44b95202e2231bdf57d44a929030ec.jpg","id":"0100C0D020B00000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"7'scarlet","nsuId":70010000087632,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Aksys Games","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250516,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/85c1c51cc88cadfb277e67d1c19ba25dced1e9eea144e583be6dcfcf82f23471.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d69d02c1ab1f556628423d2b506f4773c336718c06de342b4bdebb3cf3d5015f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/944fc2ed4a294a98f1d5d7cd1620e3493d79588a1932520d434006b13466cae7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c74862a07e245aa15061a13bef89e5af41bea69dd99ef6f17e6cc1b66cdbc2dc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b5433f7f4e87465b88c859090f3a5337798d732643cb02d3b2a75f7137c4e989.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/20d2fc0d80a44e413137c4c480f9a93a3d309dbaaef5160ff831d3be0c55b4dc.jpg"],"size":2829058048,"version":null},"70010000091874":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7fcfbaed064f70917faf473894a140e359d7b05a7acb108a52bf84b790f29e65.jpg","category":["Racing"],"description":"\u201cOn this shattered Earth of 2124, nothing is as it seems, but out on the track the truth is laid bare\u2026\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Neon Apex\u00a0\n\nOpen only to the most elite racers, both human and other, prove that you can handle breakneck speeds and perilous racecourses to win it all.\u00a0\n\nChoose your Challenger \n\nHumanities finest have gathered to prove that a human mind behind the wheel will always be best.

Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end \u2013 but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\n\nBUILD AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF CITIES\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/826e32bcdd2337d3db30beb6ee97a0f412b77c8fbad04dfc2ecbdb12ee50cd90.jpg","id":"010062F01F2CC000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Against the Storm","nsuId":70010000081350,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild fantasy themes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250627,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aaca9d684f2e362c492feee0f8fa2a79eac58e785d61b7cd149b2d85325147dc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc7fb0bdb90a3cd2683264a45f728f7fbf765bdcdbb02feafb5120222eb3f5e2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/13a5eb288f4ea7779a33e79ac94e6b3b4afca1cd459feb2172f974c3dda7a7f5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3e6fd272cd6df26d63ac4ad4ac59553798e05ec1e9940bfc59b569d4e43fff20.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7502b7d812d79066d263bf8b9289e299a647113e0b83b052e32ddc499c331f6a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cf8ed8d8dad38075a8a6344e3debaa6f5e10a67d415cce340055b964d6894dc6.jpg"],"size":2134900736,"version":null},"70010000096548":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b2c6e74a5a329af1101738befcb37ddafcbb8b899964173524bb91808877fb96.jpg","category":["Arcade","Simulation","Other"],"description":"This game is a drone simulation game that allows you to experience real drone flight based on footage shot by a real flying drone. \nThere is no up, down, left or right direction control, only the control to increase or decrease the drone speed. \nYou can also change the drone's flight mode from Normal, Sport, and Eco to any of the 3. \n\nEnjoy the beautiful scenery of Dongmak Beach, Korea with \"Real\" footage! \nThere are a total of 2 flight courses. \nHigh-definition footage faithfully reproduces the atmosphere of real nature, providing a strong sense of immersion in the game. \nSmooth and realistic video playback makes you feel like you are a real drone pilot. \nLarge capacity!

The Frogs join the effort to push back the storm, bringing their skill with stone masonry and love for water with them. Meanwhile, a changing of the tides has unlocked new potential in the distance \u2013 the Coastal Groves have finally become accessible after countless cycles spent under the deluge. Though they remain isolated and hard to reach, the ancient, submerged settlements of the area hold great treasures waiting to be uncovered. Meanwhile, unique opportunities present themselves in the once-thriving forests left barren by the march of industry \u2013 the Ashen Thicket is littered with broken trunks and remnants of a past age, awaiting a masterful Viceroy to restore its forgotten glory.\n\nAgainst the Storm - Keepers of the Stone includes:\n- Welcome the dignified Frogs to your settlements and take advantage of their proficiency with stone masonry, the comfort they take in rainwater, and their ability to increase the rate at which new citizens join your settlements.\n- Explore the new Coastal Grove biome where settlements start along the water, far from the easy reach of royal envoys and the benefits they provide. Rely instead on the Strider Port building \u2013 unique to the Coastal Grove biome, it allows you to launch expeditions seeking treasures buried in the surrounding waters. The Strider Port offers a fresh way to seek out new building designs with each expedition simply requiring a supply of food for the Water Strider and its rider alike \u2013 the more you\u2019re willing to invest in supplies, the better your potential finds might be.\n- Brave the new Ashen Thicket biome, ravaged by industrial exploitation and the Blightstorm alike.

The mean magician Godron has stolen the book \u201eMathematica\u201c from the creator of Trillion, and has cast an evil spell over the city: a ban on mathematics. Godron wants to gain power over the whole land and transform the world according to his will.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes.
