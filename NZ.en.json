Set out on an epic quest to unravel the mysteries behind the war against humanity. Even when pitted against a cosmic threat, there\u2019s always time for a bit of pinball.\n\nAbout This Game\n\nMeet Major Daaia, the best pilot the Federation has ever seen! During a routine defense operation, Daaia receives a mysterious message from humanity's mortal enemy, the Rolars. The message kick-starts an intergalactic adventure of epic proportions inspired by 80s and 90s anime. Visit alien planets, meet all kinds of weird and silly characters, and uncover the truth behind the war with the Rolars.\n\nShikon-X draws inspiration from the golden era of point and click games, though flips the genre on its head by offering an approachable and streamlined experience. No feverish mouse clicks, no verbs, and no awkward wheels of actions. There is one inventory button and one interaction button. Simply interact with a character or an object, and things will happen! In space, no one can hear you call the hint line...\n\nShikon X features a variety of playable arcade mini-games throughout the adventure. Fend off invaders from space in a retro-inspired arcade shooter, or flaunt your flipper skills in a fully-featured pinball table. Every mini-game serves a purpose, and even some story beats will develop during these scenes!\n\nKey Features\n\nStreamlined \u2018point and click\u2019 experience without any pointing and clicking\nGameplay designed with approachability in mind\nIntergalactic adventure inspired by 80s and 90s anime\nArcade mini-games that help drive the narrative forward","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a13bd768c20a992278fabba628abd8154559d44eb9cb91f1c3bc1ff6291d9f8a.jpg","id":"010017B01D90E000","intro":"Shikon-X is an intergalactic point and click adventure without any actual pointing or clicking!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","de","zh","zh"],"name":"Shikon-X Astro Defense Fortress","nsuId":70010000075050,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"WhisperGames","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Sexualised Imagery"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240726,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e7c615dadfa98578d21050fc124896debdc01fba4bb9b34e226444c79b253a2e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/92bf35a89934db48b0e28238f97e9b80b4f38efc9dca4f6cf78424165951fba3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5a51740e98ce228df7093a5275ade5a0d7d2edccae4bee6e22360440678df276.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e59beb8fc9d1ff6613d9901f3545ff4d18df744b1278e36de5eb97c6e0458c9c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/06968965be34461a0d95902434d865644f5cbff8c5086f950773bc9d51f51f26.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8f9cda063208d82d601441f6904353d2a3ca1004ad7edaead37538901c611fe.jpg"],"size":785383424,"version":null},"70010000078608":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fb58abeecbe76b3d85a10b3d6119e03fd5456d296507799c135abf056132d7a1.jpg","category":["RPG","Action"],"description":"10 years ago, a colossal earthquake devastated Tokyo and changed the lives of its inhabitants forever.

Select a clan and attempt to settle this unwelcoming land, but you\u2019ll need to choose your strategy wisely to survive the ever increasingly harsh toll of winter and complete your saga.\n\nThe thrill of a dungeon crawler with the vibe of a city builder, Landnama is a survival strategy game that forces you to carefully decide your next step. Explore the land and discover hidden challenges and powerful landmarks. Build your settlement and brace for the punishing Winter\u2019s Toll. Settle each region with differently skilled clans while facing ever increasing challenges and no second chances.\n\nOnly one resource exists in the game, Heart, but it must be invested wisely. Heart can be gained in many ways, whether you want to focus on exploring the land as a hunting clan or by building your settlement into a thriving production hub. Establish a completed settlement before winter takes your final heart, but how you get there is up to you.\n\nThis isn't your typical Viking game, there is no combat or raiding. These are farmers, explorers, and builders. But conflict isn\u2019t missing, it comes in the form of a harsh winter that you\u2019ll need every bit of your focus to survive.\n\nLandnama is a taxing race against time with an ever present ticking clock pushing you always closer to winter, but it\u2019s also a beautiful world where you can freeze time and enjoy the atmospheric music and art.

Whether you're a hardcore Monster Jam\u2122 fan or an arcade game enthusiast, this title is primed to deliver immediate driving sensations and an accessible dual-steering racing experience.\n\nFREESTYLE WITH STYLE\nBalance your truck with the perfect wheelie, eat some dirt doing crisp donuts, or reach the sky performing the greatest big air ever. The bottom line is: get ready to defy gravity in freestyle mode! Launch yourself into insane jumps, flips & stunts, ruling the leaderboards and becoming a trick master! \n\nSHOW WHO'S BOSS IN THE SHOWDOWN TOUR\nStart your career in the Showdown Tour! A non-linear adventure that will take you racing across various game modes, both in sport venues and the wilds of nature. Beat your opponents and unlock new trucks, liveries, and perks. Who's the boss now?\n\nRACE THE WILDERNESS\nRacing and jumping in stadiums and arenas is cool, but sometimes you just want to go a bit off-track, right? So, get ready to drive through the most spectacular, untamed environments. Racing through the Death Valley's dust, the forests of Colorado and the Alaskan ice. But watch out, Mother Nature is always lurking: sandstorms, thunderstorms and blizzards are going to make things even wilder!\n\nTONS OF GAME MODES\nMonster Jam\u2122 Showdown lets you unleash your sickest tricks and your off-road racing skills among several game modes. Play the original events in official Monster Jam\u2122 inspired stadiums, or go beyond reality with stunts and maneuvers that push the boundaries of what's possible, even for the most skilled driver. Racing on circuits, avoiding crashes on Figure 8 tracks, or surviving Horde races. But also performing in the Best Trick or the Extreme Freestyle mode! \nIt's time to master them all: to kick off your career and challenge with your friends, even in split screen mode.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a953cdd70597a343dd6da8de39ddf8ac9d3a190a06157f35b2110a24deaa0ff2.jpg","id":"0100CE101B698000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","zh","zh"],"name":"Monster Jam\u2122 Showdown","nsuId":70010000067262,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Milestone","rating":0,"ratingContent":["Very mild themes","In-game purchases","Online interactivity and chat"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240829,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/19607b40d985ab0f6bbd63d0929aa5249334e37860ac9b673d64da472c016a77.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d25543ea3321c70b6c12190d4ac4e85454fd05a022f803da9d7198b3d4e59c27.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b6884136b5fb39d19dc8cd9203a7ca9d7bbebeedfee6f0ff027d572947c7984b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/45fd19fdbaf6f55e6e233bc62fe3a171846405b26bdda01a1dd25c1bd5d31b58.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/359fc1d740b8b4a2bba60f078f0dde6ccf26814d4d23d9f693971c1136c6551e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cb65e4dac2e7385cb1b086d5440491dd49314dbebb1291ce74f6aab0c62a5fc3.jpg"],"size":5967446016,"version":null},"70010000072309":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b3e75d6d7d4fdee2e601b0a582ea71663cd23f93d72ecfad56d4339fe8bd6e1a.jpg","category":["Action","Fighting","Adventure"],"description":"Create your own ultimate Gundam in the newest Gundam Breaker game!\n\nIn Gundam Breaker 4 you will create and customize your own powerful Gunpla, and put it to the test in thrilling combat missions.\n\n\u2022 BREAK\nUse two different weapons at once in Gundam Breaker 4 and break off parts of your enemies to add them to your collection.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
