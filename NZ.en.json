This made every playthrough (attempt) feel different and unique.\n\nIn 2024 the highly challenging underwater shoot \u2018em up from the game development legends at Rainbow Arts is finally returning.\nININ and Ziggurat have collaborated to bring you a faithful remake completely rebuilt from the ground up and greatly improved.\n\nRedrawn:\nThe impressive sprite work of yesteryear has not only been remade into even more impressive modern high-resolution sprites but also greatly expanded upon with particle and lighting effects. 8 varied stages, the enemies, the bosses, the ships, the projectiles\u2014everything shines in a brand-new light!\n\nRemixed:\nApart from the visual journey of each playthrough, you\u2019ll embark on a musical one as well: epic synth soundscapes that drive you forward by the magnificent Chris H\u00fclsbeck. In addition to him remastering his original works, we have created six entirely new tracks as well.\n\nRemembered:\nAnd it's not just Chris H\u00fclsbeck who has returned for this remake: Ogan Kandemiroglu, the brother and co-artist of Celal Kandemiroglu who created the original iconic key art of X-Out, took on that task for the remake as a tribute.\n\nRe-equipped:\nThe shop system is back and thoroughly improved as well: new preconfigured load-outs allow you to jump straight into the action, added item descriptions help new cadets configure and build their fleet, and we've FINALLY marked the available slots for your weaponry.\n\nReinforced:\nShould you still feel overwhelmed by X-Out\u2019s challenge, then maybe it\u2019s time for a co-captain. Enlist a friend and face the terrors from the ocean deep together in the local 2-player co-op mode!\n\nReversed:\nIf you think you\u2019ve seen everything there is to the game already, then prepare to have your bearing changed and your gyro twisted in the Mirror Mode with its reverse-scrolling levels!\n\nRecapped:\n\u2022 Experience a fresh but faithful take on a real shoot-\u2019em-up classic!\n\u2022 Get dazzled by the new and beautiful sprite work mixed with shiny particle and lighting effects!\n\u2022 Take a journey through new and old synth soundscapes courtesy of composer legend Chris H\u00fclsbeck!\n\u2022 Choose one of three load-outs or build your own fleet in the improved shop system!\n\u2022 Grab a trusty ally and face the depths together in a 2-player couch co-op dive!\n\u2022 Get your world flipped, turned upside down in the Mirror Mode!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0d4de6fefb16837f6844cb403c5968c02c177d4d7aa3618982f18b15baa3ae50.jpg","id":"010048501F73E000","intro":"Relive the deep-sea classic!

However, the ancient seal was broken by Bido Klerant, a man desiring great power, and his subordinates, the Seven Beast Generals. As a result, the Dark God Emperor Daar was resurrected. Empowered by the evil god, Bido began to secretly move in order to control Kypros.\n\n\u201cBurai : J\u014dkan\u201d is an RPG released by Riverhill Soft in 1989 in Japan. It features eight brave heroes, including pirates, fortune-tellers, and the leader of the dragon clan, and follows their heroic adventures. With as many as eight protagonist-level characters, it can be hard to become emotionally invested, but the game starts before the heroes meet each other. In the early stages, you\u2019ll come to understand each hero\u2019s background and circumstances, ensuring that you\u2019ll grow attached to the characters.\n\nThe dramatic storyline they weave is one of the major attractions of the game. Another notable feature in the system is the \u201cAction\u201d command, which allows characters to improve their abilities even outside of battles, as well as the fact that each hero has weapon compatibility settings. Evaluating each hero\u2019s strengths and deciding how to develop them is an essential element in progressing through the game.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/60b87d3a120bd4f5910e4f99c7d1389aee358b993ff057f738f2f6dcf9001e02.jpg","id":"01001C5021CC6000","intro":"An RPG set in the world of Kypros, comprising the continent of Zaius and the seven islands.

In order to that humanity may thrive once again thrive once their new home was found, he creates two androids, Thunder and Kyla, and sends them in on their quest aboard the Omega 6 spacecraft.\n\nAnd thus began Thunder and Kyla's long and extraordinary adventures.\nCreators\n\nStory & Art by Takaya Imamura\nTakaya Imamura joined Nintendo in 1989 and worked on the art direction for series like Star Fox, F-Zero and The Legend of Zelda.

The mean magician Godron has stolen the book \u201eMathematica\u201c from the creator of Trillion, and has cast an evil spell over the city: a ban on mathematics. Godron wants to gain power over the whole land and transform the world according to his will.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
