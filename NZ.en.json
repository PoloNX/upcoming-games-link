    "description": "Tools Up! Ultimate Edition gives players access to the entire chaos-filled Tools Up! package, including base game, all DLCs, and updates.\n\nTime To Get Renovating\n\nGrab your tools and hard hats; we have some home makeovers to do. Tools Up! is a chaotic local co-op game that puts your renovation and teamwork skills to the test. Work your way up a sprawling apartment complex as you renovate more and more intricate homes to meet the exact (yet often bizarre) requirements of the local tenants.\n\nLocal Couch Co-Op for Up to 4 People\n\nPlay with up to 4 friends to add to the efficiency or outright chaos of your home renovation team. NOTE: This game supports local couch co-op only; there is no online multiplayer mode. The game can be played in single-player, but it is recommended to play with at least one other person.\n\nPlenty to Do Here\n\nThis isn\u2019t a simple job, so we brought in some professionals - well, kinda. Every level requires you to tackle a lot of jobs and not make a mess of it. Sweeping up after the demolition crews, painting walls, laying tiles, plastering wallpaper, collecting deliveries, and cleaning up after yourself just to start.\n\nCompetitive Home Makeovers - New PvP Mode\n\nA brand new player vs. player mode that pits your team of renovators against each other! Race to complete the most tasks possible but also interfere with the other teams every step of the way. Various gameplay modifiers will keep everyone on their toes and can be played in various combinations for up to 4 players, e.g., 1v1, 2v2, 1v2v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1, etc.\n\nTouch Up The Outdoors - All DLC Included\n\nThe Tools Up! Ultimate Edition includes all 45 levels of the Garden Party DLC. Dive into levels set in the seasons of spring, summer, and autumn as your outdoor renovation crew rebuilds patios, plants trees, spruces up lawns, and deals with a few pesky raccoons or moles.\n\nEach pack of season-themed levels comes with new mechanics, settings, and a mighty boss fight at the end!\n",

    "description": "Experience the story of Monty Mole, British subterranean mammal turned international criminal, in this fantastic collection of five games.\n\nAll Monty wanted was a quiet life, but when faced with an unbearably cold winter found himself stealing coal to survive, and that led to a life on the run from the authorities, a journey that would take him all across Europe! The Monty Mole series of adventure platformer games for home microcomputers were the brainchild of Peter Harrap, the teenage son of a mining inspector, and inspired by the 1984 mining strikes in the UK.\n\nNow you can experience the original Monty Mole saga. This collection includes the main trilogy of Wanted! Monty Mole, Monty on the Run, and Auf Wiedersehen Monty, plus two bonus games: Moley Christmas (a seasonal adventure originally given away with copies of a magazine) and Sam Stoat: Safebreaker (the solo adventure of Sam Stoat, a supporting character from the main Monty Mole games).\n\nThis collection allows you to play these classic games with many modern features, including:\n\u2022 Difficulty modes\n\u2022 Display filters, including an 80s-style CRT filter\n\u2022 Suspend points - save and restore up to 4 suspend points per game\n\u2022 Live Rewind - rewind up to 10 seconds of live gameplay with the push of a button\n\nWanted! Monty Mole\nWith a long, cold winter ahead, Monty Mole makes a daring, coal snatching raid to his local South Yorkshire pit. Do battle with flying pickets, mammal eating fish, crushers, roaming drills, hovering hairspray and more. Surfacing in Arthur\u2019s castle, you must find the only thing that can defeat him: a ballot paper.\n\nMonty on the Run\nAfter being sprung from Scudmore Prison by Sam Stoat, Monty Mole now makes a bid for freedom. Dodge tricky enemies and hazards, collect gold coins, and get to the cross-channel ferry.\n\nAuf Wiedersehen Monty\nHaving fled the UK, Monty continues to be hounded by the authorities, and has now caught the attention of Intermole, who are in hot pursuit! He must travel across Europe, gathering enough cash to finally settle down on his own private Mediterranean island, away from persecution.\n\nBonus Game: Moley Christmas\nIt\u2019s Christmas, and Monty is celebrating the season with a brand new game to be given away with copies of a computer magazine. Bizarrely, the game itself tells the story of Monty delivering the very same game to the magazine\u2019s offices! Jump, climb, dodge hazards and pick up items across four levels.\n\nBonus Game: Sam Stoat: Safebreaker\nThe mustelid malefactor Sam Stoat, who previously sprung Monty Mole from Scudmore prison, returns in his own game, looking for a big score.",

Your goal is to find your way out of the laboratory and gain your freedom by overcoming various obstacles and collecting diamonds. The game features a mix of platforming and puzzle-solving elements, with plenty of obstacles to avoid along the way.\n\nThe environment is filled with challenges, including cannons, spikes, jump pads, and windmills. Players must be very careful and think twice before making a move, as one wrong step can send them back to the beginning of the level. The game also features a variety of logical puzzles that will challenge players' problem-solving skills and test their agility.\n\nCollecting diamonds is key to unlocking the next level and progressing through the game. Players have the opportunity to become skilled navigators by mastering the platforming elements and using their quick reflexes to overcome obstacles. To jump in the game, players need to hold down the jump button to charge up their jump, and then release it to jump. This adds an extra layer of control and precision to the platforming elements.\n\nGeoJelly is a game that requires skill, patience, and strategy, making it a thrilling experience for players of all skill levels.",

    "description": "We were inspired by sandbox and simulation games, where players can create something of their own, set up processes, develop their creation, put their soul into it and show their creativity. In Cafe Owner Simulator you have such an opportunity, our goal is to give the world a game - in which everyone can realize his dream and open his own restaurant business.\n\nCleaning and Restoration.\nWhen you buy a room for your own restaurant - you will need to free it from trash and make major repairs, it is not an easy task, but what can be better than to clean up the future of a successful restaurant or cafe?\n\nCovering Surfaces.\nAfter cleaning and repairing - you will have to choose the best wallpaper, carpet or coverings of different materials, this is where your design will begin.\n\nKitchen and equipment.\nSo how do you do without kitchen equipment? Decide on the type of your future establishment and buy all the necessary equipment for it. Also, do not forget to connect it to the outlets.\n\nMenu and products\nTo open a place - you need to add a minimum of 5 dishes to the menu.\nTo prepare these dishes - you'll need products, you can buy them at the grocery store.\n\nManagement and employees\nThe game has a job market. To hire a staff member, pay a headhunter and he will find a marketable staff member for you. Every worker has his own characteristics, so choose the best ones.\nThe higher the characteristics - the higher the salary the worker wants. Over time, the motivation to work decreases - pay bonuses or hire new workers, here the choice is yours.\n\nDevelopment of the restaurant, levels\nFor performing various actions in the game - you earn experience points.\nWhen you reach a certain limit - the level grows and you get a lot of opportunities:\nnew furniture and equipment to set up, new dishes on the menu, new features on your tablet, cash rewards and more.\n\nRestaurant expansion and new features\nEarning money - you will be able to open new areas of your cafe to make all your design ideas come true. In the future it will be possible to build a hotel near the restaurant and create a square for recreation and entertainment of visitors.\n\nDuties of a restaurant owner\nLike any owner or manager of a restaurant business - there is a lot of work and daily tasks waiting for you. Paying bills, managing employees, ordering food, checking the condition of the equipment and its repair, controlling various pests and cleaning the premises, working at the cash register and at the cafe counter (until you hire employees for this), passing inspections by the fire inspector, setting up and ordering advertising, marketing, if necessary you can take a loan from the bank, but it is better to pay back in time, otherwise there will be problems, and much more.",

He and his sons left for war 150 years ago against the TRADDESS and ZOOGT empires, lightyears away from SHINORUBI.\n\nThe kingdom was entrusted to five generals close to the royal family, under the command of the king's only daughter: NEMEZIYA BA\u00c4A.\n\nNight falls on KADDIN, the capital... The endless night before the solstice of BA\u00c4A's thousand-year rule. Eight mercenaries will try the impossible under cover of night: overthrow the kingdom.\n\nSHINORUBI packs a great arcade action punch with great replayability thanks to its numerous difficulty levels, arranged modes, and player ships.\n\nThe only part of your ship vulnerable to enemy shots is the center.

Platform parkour through the remains of humanity. Outwit evolved wildlife and dangerous hybrid flora. Crack environmental puzzles that keep you guessing. And stay one step ahead of the wicked humans who are pursuing you in a twisted apocalyptic safari hunt.\n\nThe Story of a Hunted Cub\nAfter the Great Ecological Catastrophe, the ultrarich flee to Mars and leave the rest to perish. But among them a small child who developed immunity to the hostile planet remains. Decades pass and those on Mars venture back to Earth to do recon. When they spot a small human child, The Cub, they immediately try to capture it. This sets off a journey of escape, exploration and discovery through the urban ruins of humanity coupled with frantic cat and mouse chases.\n\nThis World Tells Tales\nExplore the ruins of humanity after the Great Ecological Catastrophe wipes out most of the civilization and leaves our remains to be reclaimed by an evolved mother nature. The story and clues of how and why humanity fell is strewn throughout the world. Crumbling brutalist tower blocks and abandoned genetics labs. Depleted chemical mines and overgrown battlefields. Each level has a story to tell.\n\nThe Perfect Tunes to Keep You Company\nAccompanying you on the journey is Radio Nostalgia From Mars, a custom soundtrack that\u2019ll crash land into your psyche. Sink into thought-provoking survivor stories from the few ultrarich living on Mars, while a smooth-voiced radio DJ keeps the show moving with a collection of chill apocalypse-wave tunes.\n\nIf Looks Could Bring Back Memories\nMeticulously drawn and stylized to look like the classic animated films of the late 90s - Atlantis, Tarzan, Road to El Dorado - while also taking a page from Samurai Jack\u2019s creator Genndy Tartakovsky critically acclaimed series, Primal.",

Even death will not deny the gods their game; fallen pirates become ghosts and can return to life at their gravestones. However... should the entire crew fall at the same time then the game ends with no winner - so players must balance working together in order to keep at least one crewmember alive with doing whatever it takes in order to have the most treasure at the end of the battle! Unlock the secrets, voyage across the islands and battle titanic champions in an attempt to defy the gods and attempt to survive the Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle!",

A variety of difficult enemies and bosses help you mark your time as you navigate through 30 levels spread across four worlds.\n\nA cerebral puzzler lies within the heart of this indie twist on Pong.\n\nKey Features:\n\nCerebral Puzzling: The simple, two button controls belie complex and compelling gameplay.

Hidden collectibles push you to explore every inch of the minimalist maps.\n\nA Surprise around Every Corner: qomp2 constantly delights as new features, mechanics, enemies, traps and hazards are introduced as you progress deeper into the game. Don\u2019t get complacent: As soon as you\u2019ve mastered one aspect of gameplay, another is ready to challenge you.\n\nBosses: Four challenging bosses block your path at the end of each world.

Adventure into the beautiful and treacherous lands of Kenzera as Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness. With your cosmic powers and untried courage, you advance into unknown mythological lands. Once bursting with life, Kenzera is now rife with lost ancestral spirits. As Zau advances toward his goal, three mighty beings lie in wait, fearsome in their strength yet somehow strangely familiar. Will you embrace the dance of the shaman?\n\nEmbark on a poignant single-player story shaped by actor Abubakar Salim\u2019s own experience with grief,  discovering how love gives us the courage to press on after devastating loss. Wield powers from the Sun and the Moon to defeat restless spirits in rhythmic combat and become a worthy Nganga: a spiritual healer. Discover a rich universe with untold lore of chaos & order and journey through mystical 2.5D realms awash with colour and depth, emboldened by multi-award-winning composer Nainita Desai's enchanting original score.\n\nCrafted by Surgent Studios, the entertainment studio founded by actor Abubakar Salim (Assassin's Creed: Origins, Raised by Wolves) and published by EA Originals, Tales of Kenzera\u2122: ZAU takes you on a thrilling emotional journey inspired by the rich myths of Bantu cultures.",
