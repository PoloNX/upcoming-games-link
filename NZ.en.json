Enemies that you will face will require you to adjust your strategy and equipment. In Gatewalkers, with the change of your equipment comes a change of your fight style - all the skills are attributed to particular elements of your armor and weapons. You are what you wear!\n\nThe survival part of the game will expose RPG lovers to new challenges, which are rare in this genre. Looking for resources needed to craft new weapons, maintaining good mental health in the terrifying forest, managing your body temperature at the ice world, or caring for nutrition and hydration of the character are only some of the offered mechanics.\n\nYou can play Gatewalkers solo, or in cooperation with up to 4 players.\n\nGatewalkers features:\n\nTEAM CO-OP\n\nAs a Gatewalker, one of the chosen few, you can go through the Gate and explore the worlds that lay on the other side. Team up with up to 3 other players in this team-based survival. Fight terrifying monsters, survive extreme weather conditions, follow the orders given by the Guild, and most importantly, stay alive!\n\nWORLD EXPLORATION\n\nExplore the procedurally generated worlds with unique terrain features, plants, and creatures. Discover new resources and crafting materials. Face various environmental hazards: toxic or unbreathable atmosphere, terrifying darkness, penetrating cold, and much more. Each world type introduces a unique survival mechanic that forces you to adapt. Finding food, water or wood to start a fire may be impossible. Consider carefully what to bring with you on the expedition, as no one really knows what awaits on the other side of the Gate.\n\nTEAM SURVIVAL\n\nSurviving alone in an unknown world is really hard. But with teammates at your side, you at least stand a chance. Share the responsibilities: start a fire to let others warm up, build a tent to let your mates rest, warn them about the dangers lurking in the night. The key to surviving is cooperation between you and your team.\n\nSKILL BASED COMBAT\n\nIsometric skill-based combat without auto targeting. Your skills may miss, and you can dodge enemy attacks! Good positioning during combat, balanced use of skills, proper timing and team synergy are all crucial to victory.\n\nCRAFTING\n\nChoose an item to craft. Discover the appropriate recipe. Raid different worlds to gather required resources. Find or create a crafting station. Finally, build the item and use it!\n\nYOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR\n\nThere are no predefined character classes. Each item gives you a unique set of skills, so try tinkering with different builds. Take heavy armor and a healing staff to support your mates in the front line by tanking and restoring health. Remember, you are, what you wear!\n\nPROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLDS\n\nEach time you pass the Gate you will land in a different, procedurally generated world. This gives you countless opportunities, offers constant challenges, and forces you to adapt in order to win in changing conditions! Always stay cautious, modify your strategy, make fast decisions and face their consequences, because you never know what waits around the corner.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/39fcc2d5644ae3f71c38f451c514a986486497ff8249b270f8313f4a67d87d2f.jpg","id":"01004E701CC4C000","intro":"Gatewalkers is a unique mixture of co-op game, survival and RPG.

Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end \u2013 but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\n\nBUILD AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF CITIES\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/826e32bcdd2337d3db30beb6ee97a0f412b77c8fbad04dfc2ecbdb12ee50cd90.jpg","id":"010062F01F2CC000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Against the Storm","nsuId":70010000081350,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":8,"ratingContent":["Mild fantasy themes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250627,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aaca9d684f2e362c492feee0f8fa2a79eac58e785d61b7cd149b2d85325147dc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc7fb0bdb90a3cd2683264a45f728f7fbf765bdcdbb02feafb5120222eb3f5e2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/13a5eb288f4ea7779a33e79ac94e6b3b4afca1cd459feb2172f974c3dda7a7f5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3e6fd272cd6df26d63ac4ad4ac59553798e05ec1e9940bfc59b569d4e43fff20.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7502b7d812d79066d263bf8b9289e299a647113e0b83b052e32ddc499c331f6a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cf8ed8d8dad38075a8a6344e3debaa6f5e10a67d415cce340055b964d6894dc6.jpg"],"size":2134900736,"version":null},"70010000086105":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2b6ec6da96eb4205ae023b9e52d03072586b6a079fbe8783b79c88a6c2b2527a.jpg","category":["Shooter","Action"],"description":"Imperial year 248.\n\nThe empire is in the midst of deteriorating security, hopeless diplomatic relations, and endless war.

The Frogs join the effort to push back the storm, bringing their skill with stone masonry and love for water with them. Meanwhile, a changing of the tides has unlocked new potential in the distance \u2013 the Coastal Groves have finally become accessible after countless cycles spent under the deluge. Though they remain isolated and hard to reach, the ancient, submerged settlements of the area hold great treasures waiting to be uncovered. Meanwhile, unique opportunities present themselves in the once-thriving forests left barren by the march of industry \u2013 the Ashen Thicket is littered with broken trunks and remnants of a past age, awaiting a masterful Viceroy to restore its forgotten glory.\n\nAgainst the Storm - Keepers of the Stone includes:\n- Welcome the dignified Frogs to your settlements and take advantage of their proficiency with stone masonry, the comfort they take in rainwater, and their ability to increase the rate at which new citizens join your settlements.\n- Explore the new Coastal Grove biome where settlements start along the water, far from the easy reach of royal envoys and the benefits they provide. Rely instead on the Strider Port building \u2013 unique to the Coastal Grove biome, it allows you to launch expeditions seeking treasures buried in the surrounding waters. The Strider Port offers a fresh way to seek out new building designs with each expedition simply requiring a supply of food for the Water Strider and its rider alike \u2013 the more you\u2019re willing to invest in supplies, the better your potential finds might be.\n- Brave the new Ashen Thicket biome, ravaged by industrial exploitation and the Blightstorm alike. The barren lands here are home to the rare Thunderblight Shards \u2013 lightning-infused crystals that can be mined at great cost, crucial for forging Cornerstones using the Ashen Thicket\u2019s unique Cornerstone Forge building. With only a limited number of opportunities to produce your own Cornerstones, you must strategically choose which conditions and rewards go hand-in-hand, with the option to take on penalties in the hopes of bolstering their benefit.\n- New rewards are added to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City to benefit the new Frog species alongside 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 1 new Epic Cornerstone, 3 new Rare perks, and 5 new Uncommon perks.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends.

Across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d of anime-inspired adventure, Ringo and Wolfe will have to work together to find answers, make up for past mistakes, and travel across the universe in search of their goal. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll learn how to get along at some point!\n\nTrained in the ways of Kiai, a magical form of martial art and also the universe\u2019s most exciting form of televised entertainment, Ringo can combine words to create customized attacks in intense turn-based battles. Defeat or befriend a cast of fearsome space pirates, mysterious scoundrels, cute witches, high school delinquents, talking crows, and skilled martial artists on your way to becoming a Kiai master.\n\nUSE YOUR WORDS\nCreate custom attacks by combining words up to the limit of your spirit level. The more spirit you have, the more slots you have to place words into and the more powerful and complex actions you can take.\n\nAll words have cool downs and opponents might be weak or strong against specific attacks or specific elements. You won\u2019t know which until you engage them in battle so you need to be prepared to improvise.\n\nCOLLECT THEM ALL\nWith over 200 words to collect across the game there is a near infinite number of possible unique attacks to make. As you expand Ringo\u2019s vocabulary you\u2019ll need to carefully select which words you take into battle, building strategies around your mix of categories, blend of offensive and defensive words, giving yourself options to manage your opponents weaknesses and strengths, consider optimizing the juggling of cool downs and, of course, which attacks sound the coolest.\n\nThe result is an accessible, immediately fun but deep combat system.\n\nSTEP UP WITH PEP UPS\nThe core ethos of the Kiai martial art is to fight with honor. Defeating an opponent with honor can turn the most heated of rivals into the fastest of friends! Befriend your rivals to earn their words of encouragement in the form of useful Pep Ups which can be equipped to give you special bonuses in combat.\n\nTHE STARS CALL\nTravel the universe on a rollercoaster adventure as you seek the pieces of the Wanderstar map, Ringo\u2019s lost brother and the answers to Wolfe\u2019s mysterious past.\n\nUNLIKELY ALLIES\nAlong the way you\u2019ll build a found family of colorful characters, each with their own thing going on. They might not all get along at first, but that\u2019s nothing a thrilling space adventure can\u2019t fix! And even with the trail gone cold, take heart, for these wandering stars are bound to find each other...\n\nAN ANIME YOU CAN PLAY\nInspired by anime the developers grew up watching, Wander Stars plays out across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d, each one taking between 60-90 minutes to complete. Each episode features a map to explore with procedurally generated battles, special events and other secrets to find along with the main story events.\nPlay an episode at a time, or binge the whole thing in one go! You can even replay episodes to find all the side adventures, NPCs, and party member banter you might have missed! Try new paths as you explore ever-changing maps with randomized special events, lurking rivals, and tantalizing treasures.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark?
