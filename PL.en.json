Wrong!\nIt\u2019s up to you alone to stop an alien invasion from the depths of the ocean in this legendary, home computer era shoot \u2018em up, dredged up and faithfully rebuilt for modern platforms \u2013 X-Out: Resurfaced!\n\nResurfaced:\nIn 1990, the year of X-Out\u2019s initial release on Amiga, it stood out as a breath of fresh seaside air in the stale shoot 'em-up space.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take place in \u201cspace\u201d as so many games of its genre did (and still do) but instead went for a dive through underwater worlds.\nBut what really pushed it further than its side-scrolling competitors was its shop system, allowing players to mix and match from a wide variety of ships, weapons, and other accessories to build their fleet. This made every playthrough (attempt) feel different and unique.\n\nIn 2024 the highly challenging underwater shoot \u2018em up from the game development legends at Rainbow Arts is finally returning.\nININ and Ziggurat have collaborated to bring you a faithful remake completely rebuilt from the ground up and greatly improved.\n\nRedrawn:\nThe impressive sprite work of yesteryear has not only been remade into even more impressive modern high-resolution sprites but also greatly expanded upon with particle and lighting effects. 8 varied stages, the enemies, the bosses, the ships, the projectiles\u2014everything shines in a brand-new light!\n\nRemixed:\nApart from the visual journey of each playthrough, you\u2019ll embark on a musical one as well: epic synth soundscapes that drive you forward by the magnificent Chris H\u00fclsbeck. In addition to him remastering his original works, we have created six entirely new tracks as well.\n\nRemembered:\nAnd it's not just Chris H\u00fclsbeck who has returned for this remake: Ogan Kandemiroglu, the brother and co-artist of Celal Kandemiroglu who created the original iconic key art of X-Out, took on that task for the remake as a tribute.\n\nRe-equipped:\nThe shop system is back and thoroughly improved as well: new preconfigured load-outs allow you to jump straight into the action, added item descriptions help new cadets configure and build their fleet, and we've FINALLY marked the available slots for your weaponry.\n\nReinforced:\nShould you still feel overwhelmed by X-Out\u2019s challenge, then maybe it\u2019s time for a co-captain. Enlist a friend and face the terrors from the ocean deep together in the local 2-player co-op mode!\n\nReversed:\nIf you think you\u2019ve seen everything there is to the game already, then prepare to have your bearing changed and your gyro twisted in the Mirror Mode with its reverse-scrolling levels!\n\nRecapped:\n\u2022 Experience a fresh but faithful take on a real shoot-\u2019em-up classic!\n\u2022 Get dazzled by the new and beautiful sprite work mixed with shiny particle and lighting effects!\n\u2022 Take a journey through new and old synth soundscapes courtesy of composer legend Chris H\u00fclsbeck!\n\u2022 Choose one of three load-outs or build your own fleet in the improved shop system!\n\u2022 Grab a trusty ally and face the depths together in a 2-player couch co-op dive!\n\u2022 Get your world flipped, turned upside down in the Mirror Mode!\n\u2022 Too challenging?

Unlike many adventure games, the puzzles in Taiji all use a consistent interface: a grid of tiles which can be toggled on or off.\nAlthough this might seem simple, the consistency of the interface frees the player from guesswork or pixel hunting that happens in many adventure games. It is always clear what the player must interact with in order to solve the puzzle, but it is never entirely clear what they must do. There are many different areas in the game, each with their own visual and mechanical themes.
