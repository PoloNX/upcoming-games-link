The story begins with Latok Kart, who lives with his mother, setting out on a journey to the town of Banuwa after hearing rumors of someone resembling his missing father.\n\nThis installment stands out for its emphasis on higher action gameplay compared to its predecessor. While the previous game's attack method relied on body slams, this time, players can swing swords, shoot force shots, and the introduction of jumping adds a sense of depth to the field.\n\nAnother noteworthy feature is the new \"Karma\" parameter. This parameter increases when you defeat monsters, and if it gets too high, it's considered excessive killing, and you won\u2019t gain any experience points. However, there\u2019s a way to reduce karma by visiting a church, so don\u2019t forget to stop by after your adventures.\n\nThe \"VR System,\" which was praised in the previous game for its beautiful, deep visuals, is still present. The multi-directional scrolling and visual effects, like clouds drifting across water surfaces, surpass the previous game's achievements. The game also includes features like displaying characters as semi-transparent when they\u2019re hidden behind buildings and more refined parameter displays. Xak II is a meticulously crafted game, recommended for those who want to enjoy high-action gameplay and the well-developed world of Xak.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fc9062ec19468685645f1da6f9e41701c87c1016c27b51d4f1c1c9eac6b97201.jpg","id":"01006DB020BAE000","intro":"This game not only enhances the visual beauty but also improves the action elements.

Get ready to experience the cutest and most fun sports game you've ever played. With colorful graphics, adorable characters, and exciting gameplay, you'll have a blast competing in various sports activities. Let's play!\n\nLOCAL MULTIPLAYER\nYou can play with up to 4 people, making it perfect for game nights, family gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. Choose your characters, divide into two teams and prepare for endless hours of fun and laughter for everyone.\n\nNO RULES!\nEach sport has a set of rules to decide how points are scored... but nothing about how player should behave\u2026 So, feel free to block the basket, stun the opponent, block their way or invade the opponent's field!\n\nRANDOMLY GENERATED TERRAIN\nImagine playing a sports game where every time you start a new game, you encounter a completely new terrain. No match will ever be the same again!. Adapt your strategies to the ever-changing terrain to become the ultimate champion!\n\nSEVEN BALL SPORTS\nEnjoy playing classic sports like soccer or basketball and also discover other cultural sports like Pelota Vasca or Ulama that are not so well known but just as fun! Create championships choosing the sports you like the most and show your skills!\n\n- Soccer\nA classic, two goals and two teams. Whoever puts the ball into the opposing team's goal the most times wins. Take advantage of the curves and mushrooms in the environment to gain position or hit from higher.\n\n- Basket\nThis game consists of putting the ball through the opponent's metal hoop and is played with the hands... well, not in this case... Our friends have adapted it a bit to play... with the head... and huge wooden baskets!\n\n- American Football\nRunning after a strange shaped ball and hitting the opponent to take it away is a sport. Yes, and it is very intense. Grab the egg shaped ball and take it to a safe area avoiding being caught! Kick it if you are in trouble!\n\n- Tennis\nA sport where players try to hit a small, yellow ball over a net, without hitting it too hard or too soft. It's like a beautiful dance, but with more shouting and the occasional racquet smash. And good luck finding that little yellow ball in the bushes.\n\n- Volley Ball\nPass the ball to the field of the opposing team. In this case you can use the net both to bounce the ball and to climb on it with the help of the jumping mushrooms.\n\n- Basque Pelota\nHitting a rock-hard ball with your hand to send it against a wall? Yes, and it's really attractive! It is played in turns and each time the ball hits the wall, the team that serves changes. Be careful not to send it too low or too high.\n\n- Ulama\nWhat? Have you never heard of Ulama? Listen and enjoy. A traditional game in the Mayan culture that is played with the hips! Invade opponent field with the ball. In Narona you also play with your head. A huge ring on the wall means that if you pass the ball through it you get 5 points! Frankly fun!\n\nCUTE CHARACTERS\nFive girls and five boys are the brave ones who have gone out to the forests of Narona to play and have fun. With different speed, strength and jump force, each one takes advantage of its skills in each sport. The smart girl, the lazy boy, the big guy, the jock, the music fan, the strong one, the scared little one, the handsome and nice guy and the weird girl with the tattoos... there's room for everyone!\n\nSKINS AND REWARDS\nCustomize your experience by unlocking different skins for each character.

Peruse the pages of a Lovecraftian tale, interact with maps and solve the puzzles encountered along the way. Trace your master's footsteps to uncover the deepest secrets of the arcane, on a quest brimming with horror and magic.\n\n\nEmbark on a Disturbing Journey\nAlas, I knew not of the extraordinary, bizarre, and gut-churning sights that awaited within those walls.\n\nThe year is 1520. You receive a letter from your old mentor, the first step on an unnerving journey like none before. One that shall expose you to the forbidden arcane and all its mystery in which you shall concoct mixtures both wondrous and strange, and summon forth beings of other-worldly power. You must steel yourself, for terrors buried deep within shall soon awaken within you, Dantean horrors that bleed into reality. Endure these trials and, in time, the truth shall draw near. Yet will you be brave enough to pay its price?\n\nAn Immersive Literary Feat\nIts lauded writing aside, 49 Keys is an audio-visual work of art. Intricately-designed menus hark back to manuscripts of the Middle Ages through to the Renaissance, with a unique art style throughout. Pore over incredible full-colour illustrations, and feel the thrill as original themes perfectly complement each twist and turn. All this combines for a deeply immersive world.\n\nUnique Riddles and Marvellous Mysteries\nAkin to point-and-click adventures, 49 Keys has you search through a meticulously-crafted world collecting items to aid you in solving its myriad puzzles. Read every word with care, for vital clues are hidden within. Put your reasoning skills to the test, and push onward; but fear not\u2014an array of detailed in-game tips are at hand, if ever you need them.\n\nDirectly Adapted From The Best-Seller\n49 Keys was developed and adapted by the original author behind the 2022 gamebook of the same name (49 Chiavi), a best-selling puzzle adventure. Gaining overwhelming praise from critics, it also achieved a place on Italy's 2022 gamebook best-seller list, going on to win two highly-coveted awards that year.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7750785cdd964b43adc472ed804a6d07519d5a4eb05f66440a8b474ea6b3a733.jpg","id":"0100D2601F3FE000","intro":"In this book-based puzzler, a captivating tale unfolds before you.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Bad Language","Sex"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70050000052465":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/786f0b737d8892c7c2af512af6ca42dcde85fc2928287d590ce5347078fb8f1f.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enjoy a new original scenario, including new quests and stories.\n\nNote:\n- This product is scheduled to become available by the end of January 2025.\n\n- Content can be accessed after reaching a designated point in the game.\n- The details and release dates of any content may be changed with no notice.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
