Serving as humanity's gateway to the cosmos, it now stands as a chilling testament to an experiment gone wrong.\nAs the protagonist, you awaken in the cold sterility of the medical bay, disoriented and alone. The eerie silence is broken only by the hum of malfunctioning machinery. An unsettling darkness envelops the lunar base, casting shadows that seem to writhe and pulse with malevolence.\n\nExploring the abandoned corridors and chambers, you discover cryptic remnants of the crew's activities \u2013 hasty recordings, fragmented logs, and ominous experiments conducted in the name of advancing human knowledge. It becomes clear that the crew's scientific pursuits unleashed an ancient extraterrestrial force, one that feeds on fear and has twisted reality within the confines of AstroGenica Lunar Nexus.\nThe nightmare deepens as you encounter grotesque manifestations of the crew's worst fears brought to life by the insidious lunar entity. Each step forward reveals more about the base's descent into madness, and the horrifying fate that befell those who once called it home.\nArmed with only a flickering flashlight and your wits, you must navigate the increasingly nightmarish lunar landscape, solving puzzles, avoiding otherworldly threats, and piecing together the fragments of a dark cosmic secret. The lunar base holds the key to your survival, but it also harbors the eldritch horrors spawned by humanity's reckless curiosity.\n\nAs you inch closer to the heart of the lunar nightmare, the line between reality and delusion blurs, and the chilling truth awaits discovery. Will you unravel the mystery, or become another victim of the lunar entity's insatiable hunger for fear? The fate of AstroGenica Lunar Nexus rests in your hands, and the lunar nightmare may leave scars that transcend the boundaries of space and time.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/38bfa7ef85beec585d0841d14b82c5f8a300224b5e90107bb53923855fb85aca.jpg","id":"01004640200BC000","intro":"Lunar Nightmare is a retro-inspired sci-fi thriller, set on an abandoned Moon base...","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Lunar Nightmare","nsuId":70010000085021,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Playstige Interactive","rating":16,"ratingContent":["Strong Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240816,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c70efe32311becd84cb02557ec4b341bca557dabb1be8b1e5d91b3b0ea407d3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3a88f05074480da566d09a3629105d9f583dbb11e43f025817fd62adeac2a28e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4033faa163f6719ed469b5ef64589be6c4101e1f90554569a49e0b0f597a52a9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ddf509de69cae947cb0ff93144f7cca6d337594e3e3ef2bcdc4082b7bf765fdf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e09ad85e545c773db00d10a1b999a308e207bf851c093e7977a196e655aa72b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/95fd35818b7eead34ad21d097314849cc6abbc8a25446b4b75ed4d5f6141ae84.jpg"],"size":7600078848,"version":null},"70010000085188":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2a3ac697c34c172e42ce9ca60c54346c8b633975aa86bb03d6e47870849f3af9.jpg","category":["Adventure","Puzzle","Other"],"description":"Do you have what it takes to steal the treasure without leaving a trace?

Beware the descending Fog and lead the islanders in fending off the rebels and their Eldritch allies!\n\nGameplay\n\nExplore corpse-filled streets and dank cave systems or cleanse secret underground tunnels of the rituals aiming to grow the Fog\u2019s influence. As you search for a way to stop the ongoing destruction, you're sure to stumble upon some of the deepest, darkest secrets of the island.\n\nChoose from an arsenal of devastating top-of-the-line firearms: hand-cannons, triple-barrel shotguns, as well as prototype weaponry from the great Nikola himself.\n\nBreak just about anything, kick barrels of oil and set them on fire, or just straight up give the boot to your enemies and watch them trigger traps.

Embark on an exciting adventure fit for both new players and long-time fans, highlighting classic and new SaGa franchise features, full Japanese and English voiceovers, rearranged compositions, and much more! \n\nSTORY \nIn an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist.\nThe knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.\n\n\u25a0Free-Form Scenario \nThe game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first\u2014from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey.\n\n\u25a0Combat \nThe strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!\n \n\u25a0Graphics \nThe original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.\n \n\u25a0Difficulty Settings \nSelect from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). \nCasual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.\n\n\u25a0Music & Voices \nKenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen.\nFurthermore, all event scenes now feature full Japanese and English voice acting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/85cd020706d10c0672fc1e3a7316774e44a78948514819ed95ef7ddbd0d6cc91.jpg","id":"010045301B86C000","intro":"Save Your Empire.

As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects.

It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
