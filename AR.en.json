Every time you visit a world, the story will evolve, allowing the protagonist and player alike to discover new possibilities.\nAs the story unfolds in this way it becomes a tale all of your own, not only affecting the path you walk but also the multiple potential endings that await each protagonist. \n \nBattles where a Single Choice Can Change Everything:\nSaGa Emerald Beyond further refines the highly strategic Timeline Battles the SaGa franchise has been long renowned for. With series mainstays such as the skill to spontaneously acquire abilities through the Glimmer system, tactical ally placement known as Formations, and United Attacks that enable individual skills to connect together to form devastating chain attacks, it offers the best iteration of SaGa's turn-based combat to date. \n \nThe new combat system adds more drama than ever before, allowing you to support party members, interrupt enemy actions, and use United Attacks by strategically manipulating the order of ally actions.\n \nThe characters that join you, the weapons you wield, your party formation, and your tactics in battle - everything is up to you!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2b558dc6c1733239b7015b60a874b95dba40addcd3c612edee5ffe1c30083043.jpg","id":"01008BE01E1C2000","intro":"FORGE YOUR OWN TALE","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"SaGa Emerald Beyond","nsuId":70010000077231,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"SQUARE ENIX","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence","Mild Language","Suggestive Themes"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240425,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/469d08590e1b1b7a27e8c35eb67ee872999eb87d86c2a613f220e63cd077d332.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5ab5ccb53796f4f05646911f330cb9d2b1dea7640868b3b8a094a804072b744e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c975d0c0b74698cc017d432cfde2f1c543ee0d23a4a9adbb91963e367c602e4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/83a207289c9a9a3c84507aea69162a4356e736384bcdce8cbbe124f3e5de0be0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2cecaf3f3783317597b5da801ba4149cbd05ba0c1531c09233e1c933c7b9f6e5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/84129335963af7173c8cf2a8196c9b123335c96cecde03f279a11dbfb7ec273a.jpg"],"size":3770679296,"version":null},"70010000077469":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9bf53e2f6995be9bee1bbbce6c38b5e649d6d9004dd14495b837431b8d76748c.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","Platformer","Fighting"],"description":"Immerse yourself in the exciting world of Teared, a thrilling 3D arcade action platformer.

Delve into the tale of a once-glorious kingdom ensnared by darkness, a story that begins with a young boy haunted by prophetic dreams. As evil corrupts the heart of the Sarook King, leading him to command his monsters against his own people, the stage is set for an epic saga.\n\nThe Premise:\nUncover the legend of a kingdom plunged into despair, betrayed by its monarch. In the mystical realm of Sarook, a young hero is awakened by visions of light, only to find his world threatened by a malevolent force. The king, once a protector, now spreads terror, commanding a legion of beasts to ravage his land.\n\nThe Game:\n\"Adventure Field\u2122 Remake\" is a turn-based JRPG that reimagines the original classic with breathtaking 3D graphics. Navigate through treacherous dungeons, battle formidable enemies, and uncover the secrets of the kingdom. Embark on a quest to locate the 100 hidden mandragoras scattered across Sarook, unlocking one of 15 exclusive in-game achievements.\n\nShiny Monsters:\nPrepare for encounters with rare, color-varied monsters that offer a bounty of 10 times the usual experience and gold. With a 1 in 100 chance to stumble upon these shiny creatures, each battle could be a windfall.\n\n2 Difficulty Modes:\nChoose your challenge with two distinct difficulty settings: Remake and Classic. Classic mode raises the stakes\u2014no healing upon leveling up, increased inn costs, deactivated healing crystals in dungeons, and the absence of hidden items. It's a true test of your strategic prowess and endurance.\n\nAs darkness descends upon the Kingdom of Sarook, the legend awaits your intervention. Only you can prevent the fall of the kingdom in this gripping remake. Will you rise as the hero Sarook needs, or will the shadows claim victory?","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fd4f775915ab3d9839a36df14a048649f130a29f4fef8100b4052517614bb88d.jpg","id":"0100B6A01E59E000","intro":"Embark on a legendary journey to save the kingdom of Sarook from darkness in Adventure Field\u2122 Remake, now enhanced for Nintendo Switch\u2122.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Adventure Field\u2122 Remake","nsuId":70010000078181,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Elushis","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence","Mild Blood"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240506,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/51370df700fc3d8c14c66a80464971ef5ad1e7eda5bb98edaed10be2fe875128.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8d74b7ca910b3b86d0d8eb718fd1cf2a5357edbc4909097c7a83bfa215c28b2c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6445b288c995637fac9bec9ee9edc9c211f6346ba911c995937c59bfcdcafd50.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b28b5a6fe3ceef3feb0bfdca7a82c9cecfe685583538f455940c6fcc8a4173ea.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5c39982b4dc1a12b165133063c154971a05ed5067e65a1920177cc9a9dbc36db.jpg"],"size":3204448256,"version":null},"70010000065691":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bd83ab5e8239722001cccb844a7226ce42810e1343877473d1325686bfd49a77.jpg","category":["Arcade"],"description":"Pre-order now and get the following bonus content for PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs:\n\u2022 Chomp Challengers PAC (in-game cosmetic items)\n- 1 body: Unicorn - Rare\n- 3 heads: Crown, Pompadour, Punk\n- 2 faces: Googly Glasses, Retro Glasses\n- 1 icon: Cherry Chomp\n\nPAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs is an online-only PAC-MAN eating competition!

You can choose to adventure with whoever you'd like! There truly is a favorite for everyone to bond with, I promise.\n\n- Tons of enemies for you to FIGHT or BEFRIEND! - This world has no shortage of intense battles with opponents that range from weird, wacky, tough, cute, and outright goofy!\n\n- Vigorous mental challenges, and intense puzzles! - You may face mind-bendingly difficult challenges such as \"Spell Richard\" and \"Carry A Feather\" throughout your Rhapsody. Would you dare come face to face with the infamous 3x3 slide puzzle?\n\n- Varying battle mechanics to always keep the action fresh! - Many characters will switch up the tactics of battle, you'll be faced with various minigames based on the scenario you find yourself in.\n\n- Absolutely hilarious. - This game is fast paced, action packed, and full of zany and ironic humor that anyone can have a nice laugh at.\n\n- Lots of rabbit holes, secrets, and suspicious endeavors! - You will NOT run out of things to do. If you do, you probably haven't seen the sunlight in quite some time!\n\n- Choose your own adventure! - Nothing substantial in this game is up to RNG. You choose your pathway from start to finish, creating an extremely specific pathway which'll then be recorded - this is your playthrough's Rhapsody, a narrated story of your journey through Athens! When you come to the end of the line and reflect upon your Rhapsody, could you say you did your best?\n\n- Last but not least... An Online Social System!
