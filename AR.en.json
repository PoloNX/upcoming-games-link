But before they find mankind's new home, they must locate the ultimate treasure in some ancient ruins to pay off... a planetary loan?! Their quest will take them to three different planets, the first planet is Impostar, a planet filled with aliens from all four corners of space. The second planet is Igni, a fiery planet with a harsh environment. The third planet is Froslara, a planet as frozen as its residents are rich.\nAnd on every planet, new encounters and incidents await!\n \nOver 100 aliens! An adventure combo-meal of mystery & drama!\nDuring your treasure hunt, unexpected encounters await at every turn via random events. You can explore freely while working as a bounty hunter, delivery person, or just shopping for items: how to play is up to you. For the completionists, there's a gallery to record all the intergalactic rogues you meet, sub-missions, and training where you can battle powerful opponents! Contrary to its name, space is very full!\n\nBattle rival treasure hunters and a plethora of aliens in card-based battles!\nTreasure attracts trouble, leading to card-based battles with anyone from rival treasure hunters to unknown aliens lurking about. With a set number of cards in your hand, read through your opponent\u2019s strategy and forge a path to absolute victory! Inside your spaceship is a bonsai that bears fruits.
