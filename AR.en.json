Oxytone invites you to explore the depths of your mind while offering a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life for those seeking relaxation. For more determined players, there are 99 challenges, colorful themes to unlock, and 12 meticulously designed maps. Oxytone is the ultimate puzzle game, equally easy to learn and challenging to master.\n\nStrive for the highest scores by creating the longest paths and achieving impressive combinations. Every move matters, and success depends on strategy and planning. You can discard tiles that don't fit your plan, but this reduces your pool of available tiles. To refresh it, you must fill tiles by guiding paths through them six times, deepening the mechanics further.\n\nSound is an integral part of Oxytone, so I recommend playing with headphones. This will immerse you even deeper into the game.

Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you!\nDid we mention wildfires?\n\nTrackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way.\n\nThe game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists.\n\nGATHER RESOURCES\nThere aren't many resources in the desert, so you\u2019ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way.\n\nUNLOCK BLUEPRINTS\nYou\u2019ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, it\u2019s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely.\n\nBUILD\nWith enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key.\n\nDEFEND\nAttacks are frequent. You\u2019ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, you\u2019ll have to be more creative with how you use them.\n\nKEEP THE TRAIN GOING\nFeed your train with fuel, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything. Try to automate things to keep moving as the game gets harder and harder with time and distance.\n\nFEATURES\n- High replayability value\n- Many items to gather and craft\n- Multiple game modes\n- Mini quests to complete\n- Random deterministic map generator","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8a14f6a207f6d8acbb157c58be888701450234566f216dad3053b97e3870ab59.jpg","id":"0100AD801E6F8000","intro":"Embark on a thrilling journey through an unforgiving desert.
