Created in a hand-drawn and collage art style reminiscent of cozy picture books, it presents a harbor populated with surprising creatures such as the scrapcrabs and the bobcat kittens, but also yummy \u201cmousemallows\u201d. \n\nThe SOLO adventure is suitable for young children on their own thanks to specific accessibility features. It doesn\u2019t require knowing how to read and can be played with a touch screen. With short gameplay stages that enable trial and error, Mouse & Crane befits different skill and experience levels.\nIn this mode, players control Crane\u2019s arm. They start with just a hook to transport things like containers or Mouse himself, and progressively discover various upgrades such as a giant magnet to grab metal scraps and tools, or a wrecking ball for the most satisfying demolitions!\n\nMouse & Crane also shines in CO-OP with the child and parent (or an older sibling) working creatively together to solve puzzles that can't be completed alone, sharing digital moments. In this mode, one player plays as Crane while the other can make Electryna move and jump with fun motion controls, helping Mouse get new tools... Electryna\u2019s swiftness and electric powers are a delight. \n\nThe game is produced by two studios from Denmark and Canada that are experienced in creating meaningful and wholesome experiences for children. Mouse & Crane shows the power of cooperation, creativity, upcycling and DIY crafting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/edebd27aec7891069ed63eea7d40cca030da96448656e9da56f491653a8c93a2.jpg","id":"010053B01F3F4000","intro":"Ideal as a child\u2019s first game, Mouse & Crane is a single or multiplayer adventure offering creative puzzle-solving moments through cooperation, upcycling and construction.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","fr"],"name":"Mouse & Crane","nsuId":70010000081605,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Those Eyes","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240621,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80313b5718caa9689f6784baa1e9939bde5d156405ebf5af158a53288f6a3eef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e71e9873c7c6bf6cf72a09ff0bcf89a1116625c3ce5fc402ee972030229608a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8ae08d6ff3261ac3b415fa359840e416a02d716617ed12adff48777bcb84b61b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2beae13defe99ee9ce700941dd2e72a750ab63c3534cc60c37c51d1463c5a0de.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/235fb000bb0be96019cd24cded7dcea3686b60d7fa155e98484970b7e565d717.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc99a435a31b4b8387c1a0021521935b3cfee1b513a6a405e9c4d80725ac044a.jpg"],"size":776994816,"version":null},"70010000081051":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/05a6c93a26ce7d33c8d0ab1281e4d15ea0ceb305090e4d4c8ce282ba38a86833.jpg","category":["Arcade","Action","Adventure","Simulation"],"description":"Control the hungry snake on the hunt for food to grow longer and bigger.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised.
