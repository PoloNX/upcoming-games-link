But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset. \n\nExperienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!\nTeams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!\n\nWAYS TO PLAY\nPlay solo or online. Be tethered together in local or online Co-Op. Race your friends in local Splitscreen. Enjoy the chaos of Fling to the Finish in a way that fits you.\n\nCOURSES!\nEvery course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next. \n\nATTACKS!\nOpponents battle back with hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers if they fall behind. Our items keep the races interesting, and help even the score if one player has more experience than another.  \n\nSHARE A CONTROLLER\nBecause you're literally attached to your partner, Fling to the Finish is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through Fling to the Finish by sharing a controller with your partner. \nThis control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game.

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era. This feature allows players to learn about Yoshiwara, even aspects that many Japanese people are unfamiliar with. Additionally, the game supports English and Simplified Chinese, enabling players from different language regions to explore and learn about Japan\u2019s Edo period.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/18b8e1558f9af283c908914584dac0fdc624ad2c8db8b26b2fd9361e8a4d9b8d.jpg","id":"0100D14021E4A000","intro":"A Time loop mystery set in Japan\u2019s Edo period!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh"],"name":"GHOST TRAVELER: Adventures in Edo","nsuId":70010000097776,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"SUCCESS","rating":17,"ratingContent":["Blood","Intense Violence","Partial Nudity","Sexual Themes","Strong Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251016,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de6f4dad0480e5705c8f3e93d1ba0fe377afb688f91259cbc8a3fa63e068ca9e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/25e88f73150091b2b86dc3c6d9164075a149de6e1780865ce5e049a5ad95db1a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2d4203bd9d7fba4f2582a2457337e34059c0c19ae063e84038ab74c944024c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a890c1da6f7356a724f82461bc79ee808bcea193a035dafd4c2a2e3e34762f10.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a21b5fd243cd30eda0f2a9c3604965876bed8bcf2ea5906eee0733db58a1d66c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1ae2395cbd2852e932e3116e0d0e49e26c2392054dba66863566a1fba2567344.jpg"],"size":2091909120,"version":null},"70010000099365":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/870d2482d0369ab35e5615e585b8908c0365f1901d0ac39be73c5e922ad4b4ec.jpg","category":["RPG","Action"],"description":"Lumiose City\u2014a home for people and Pok\u00e9mon alike.
