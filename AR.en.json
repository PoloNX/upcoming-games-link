Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event.\n\nFrom the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely.\n\nYou must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates.\n\nHowever, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone?\n\nUltimately, everything is about choices and consequences.\n\nFeatures\n\nChoose how you want to follow the game\u2019s story.\n\nThe complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. \n\nYou can concentrate on just one particular character\u2019s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. \n\nYou can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline \u2013 essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause.\n\nOr you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses. \n\nWatch and change things as many times as you like\n\nCan\u2019t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you\u2019re not sure you like the consequences? That\u2019s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like.\n\nChange the past to affect the future\n\nSetting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events. As you look back through the timeline, past events play out in front of you in ghostly form, with the smoke and fire damaged house a constant reminder of what is to come. In addition, as you manipulate the past, the environment can be reset around you to match the changes taking place. Some new objects will appear, others will move around the house and the contents of rooms can change substantially as you change the past.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f7de6d0e5693aa383007bf3ad68fa10e070cef02dfb4a17ef6814a6a2fa38eb8.jpg","id":"0100C64016B0C000","intro":"Eternal Threads is a single-player, first-person story-driven puzzle game of time manipulation, choice and consequence.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["pt","en","es","fr","de","ru","zh","zh"],"name":"Eternal Threads","nsuId":70010000047647,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Secret Mode","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Language","Sexual Themes","Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240523,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5031a7faa8b33ef8e53aff4b34aecf8f95f473df5b36dcde3b07bd014b60a52d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5d91b7acaa64339850bda922c5fa2148fa1e274ef6a0b69dfbf59d33525e9724.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d8ae8873580db9f7e0081c2bcc0342e4668c2ceea8dc1442ff3a9f8dc6b41ddd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a021808fb070b88557a481a72fbc99e4f723d58cc26ed15ca1cbd49cf05fd89e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0e1e67517a6557292b9f93226b773f4c989e2fa617bc054d0b7d8d08fb3a03b0.jpg"],"size":4654628864,"version":null},"70010000051379":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ee4342fbb978f18dca062fb6336c2058afd18713282c3e20458f0a6b7285c6a0.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","RPG"],"description":"From the creators of Morbid: The Seven Acolytes... experience a blood-soaked action adventure with souls-like elements.

We all think that we could do a better job ourselves in running a country compared to politicians, but is that really true? With one eye on the budget, the other on the polls, and somehow finding time to watch out for terrorist attacks at the same time, you will find that staying in power while changing society for the better is a tougher job than you ever imagined.\n\nThis is a strategy game, where the outcome of your policies and laws reflects on your success. If you want to abolish all public spending and all taxes, you can do that. It might work, it might not, depending on how you handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to nationalise the railways, energy and water companies, cap CEO pay, ban second-home ownership, and put universal income in place, you can do that too. Democracy 4: Console Edition models the likely effects, short and long-term, of any action you take so you can see what kind of country you can run.\n\nBuilt on a custom-built neural network designed to model the opinions, beliefs, thoughts and biases of thousands of virtual citizens, Democracy 4: Console Edition is the state-of-the-art in political simulation games. \n\nUltimately, Democracy 4: Console Edition is not a game about simply winning an election, but about running the country. Losing an election is just the endgame (unless you get assassinated). The real challenge is whether you can create a country you are proud of.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/13e4e74a9ffc9f2cd1381be927fc5f52482c24cfc68693dce53bbd2f7f87d306.jpg","id":"010010701C504000","intro":"Democracy 4: Console Edition lets you take the role of President / Prime Minister in one of ten countries.

And while Head is slowly but surely deflating, you have a chance to save its life.\nTo do so, you must use air tanks to keep Head inflated while you explore Airhead\u2019s metroidvania-style world, searching for amazing abilities and upgrades that will unlock new areas and puzzles for you to overcome.\n\nOn your adventure, it will be up to you to uncover the true connection between Head, the air tanks, and the technology that litters the world, so you can save Head no matter the cost.\n\nEXPLORATION\nFinding your way through Airheads world is not always easy.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
