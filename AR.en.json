Join Hatch, a flightless hawk mountaineer equipped with a powerful hookshot, on a perilous journey to confront the evil Nazar, and save the kingdom from his icy grip.\n\nThe many tales of Hatch's saga will take him from the comfort of his homeland to the far, untamed edges of the kingdom. Encountering powerful foes and dangerous hazards. Unlocking amazing abilities and experiencing wonders never before dreamed of. Whether these tales end in triumph, or become cautionary, rests on the shoulders of our young hero.\n\nAn urgent letter from the Queen of Talonreach:\n\nHatch,\n \nI write to you in desperate times.\n\nThe Eight Sacred Artifacts of Talonreach \u2014 symbols of hope and guardians of the realm \u2014 have been stolen! Buried within the treacherous Frozen Dungeons scattered across the Kingdom, these relics once sealed away a nightmare so great that elders still tremble at the mere whisper of his name.\n\nNazar, the Frozen Wraith, has risen from his induced slumber, ice cracking beneath his cursed steps. With each breath, winter tightens its grip on the land, and his hunger for destruction grows ever more insatiable. His goal is clear: to shroud the world in eternal frost, turning all living things into monuments of frozen despair.\n\nHatch, the Kingdom calls upon you. The Ember Sprites, with their fiery magic, hold the key to unlocking the Frozen Dungeons. With their help, you can reclaim the lost Artifacts and restore the balance that once held Nazar captive. Only when these relics are united will you be able to breach the heart of Nazar\u2019s Frozen Fortress and challenge him in his lair.\n\nBut haste is of the essence. Already, Nazar\u2019s poison affects the Kingdom, ensnaring villages and souls alike in his icy prisons. The road ahead is fraught with peril \u2014 traps, monsters, and dark magic wait to test your resolve at every turn.

Embark on an exciting adventure fit for both new players and long-time fans, highlighting classic and new SaGa franchise features, full Japanese and English voiceovers, rearranged compositions, and much more! \n\nSTORY \nIn an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist.\nThe knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.\n\n\u25a0Free-Form Scenario \nThe game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first\u2014from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey.\n\n\u25a0Combat \nThe strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!\n \n\u25a0Graphics \nThe original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.\n \n\u25a0Difficulty Settings \nSelect from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). \nCasual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.\n\n\u25a0Music & Voices \nKenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen.\nFurthermore, all event scenes now feature full Japanese and English voice acting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/85cd020706d10c0672fc1e3a7316774e44a78948514819ed95ef7ddbd0d6cc91.jpg","id":"010045301B86C000","intro":"Save Your Empire.

She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.\n\nDon't even think about trying to romance her. It won't end well for you.\n\nHopefully you won't die. But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!\n\nNo time loops. Don't be ridiculous.

The Den, The Apotheosis and The Fury each have more than doubled in length.\n\nOver 35% more content overall\u2014and all of it filled with great opportunities to listen to me and do your job.\n\nA new ending. And hopefully one that saves the world rather than damns it. \n\nTrack Your Progress: Cherish your memories, relive your exploits, and uncover deeply hidden secrets with the new gallery feature.\n\nOver 1,200 New Hand-Penciled Frames hand-illustrated by Abby Howard.\n\nOver 2,500 New Lines of Dialogue fully voiced dialogue by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.\n\nYes, prepare yourself for an expanded journey filled with new perils, difficult choices, and unforgettable encounters.

It begins at an eerie fairground, where an omniscient narrator introduces you to its unsettling attractions. As you explore, you\u2019re drawn to the infamous haunted house.

Even after completing a level and earning all the stars, you can replay it, with each attempt offering a fresh new experience. This ensures that the game remains engaging and never repetitive.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1aa3d1845208b62b066b775578290330ed4fba52870692c7acc5eca489a20452.jpg","id":"01007780205B4000","intro":"Repair magical pots with cats!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en"],"name":"Magic Cats Pots","nsuId":70010000086075,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"RedDeer.Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20241031,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b4c440dc0e72559270ba3e5f0e61dc629d7aaa5eb5fb6548f2bf6ac3f538d5e7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2b903cc6eb4b2034cfb57a33397b2455003fc913e7cb3326c3a41fcec0e92f60.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8e9b3d2ada63b1b8941f6e62b51a187c0dc183e0dc7aa732227471cd7971c87c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7f4a578a949ce3fc5a996bd2a6860fc72fac5ecc41895d4ec3ffac7c2225bbde.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f9221d53f6bf050e981e4b23b350d986aded66f7a18f9da19fa6f1ccdfd0d594.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f2eb38c3c4983a6673c47777e4d8d32f38ddf1f3b118c43cec56b467c281f0d0.jpg"],"size":510656512,"version":null},"70010000087052":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e8b68d85e9de30674dbbc35e0c030e133975bd8285733ad4e9cd7c44bdc37d88.jpg","category":["Puzzle","Board Game","Strategy","Training"],"description":"Background: In the near future, mankind has conquered the universe.

With colorful graphics, adorable characters, and exciting gameplay, you'll have a blast competing in various sports activities. Let's play!\n\nLOCAL MULTIPLAYER\nYou can play with up to 4 people, making it perfect for game nights, family gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. Choose your characters, divide into two teams and prepare for endless hours of fun and laughter for everyone.\n\nNO RULES!\nEach sport has a set of rules to decide how points are scored... but nothing about how player should behave\u2026 So, feel free to block the basket, stun the opponent, block their way or invade the opponent's field!\n\nRANDOMLY GENERATED TERRAIN\nImagine playing a sports game where every time you start a new game, you encounter a completely new terrain. No match will ever be the same again!. Adapt your strategies to the ever-changing terrain to become the ultimate champion!\n\nSEVEN BALL SPORTS\nEnjoy playing classic sports like soccer or basketball and also discover other cultural sports like Pelota Vasca or Ulama that are not so well known but just as fun! Create championships choosing the sports you like the most and show your skills!\n\n- Soccer\nA classic, two goals and two teams. Whoever puts the ball into the opposing team's goal the most times wins. Take advantage of the curves and mushrooms in the environment to gain position or hit from higher.\n\n- Basket\nThis game consists of putting the ball through the opponent's metal hoop and is played with the hands... well, not in this case... Our friends have adapted it a bit to play... with the head... and huge wooden baskets!\n\n- American Football\nRunning after a strange shaped ball and hitting the opponent to take it away is a sport. Yes, and it is very intense. Grab the egg shaped ball and take it to a safe area avoiding being caught! Kick it if you are in trouble!\n\n- Tennis\nA sport where players try to hit a small, yellow ball over a net, without hitting it too hard or too soft. It's like a beautiful dance, but with more shouting and the occasional racquet smash. And good luck finding that little yellow ball in the bushes.\n\n- Volley Ball\nPass the ball to the field of the opposing team. In this case you can use the net both to bounce the ball and to climb on it with the help of the jumping mushrooms.\n\n- Basque Pelota\nHitting a rock-hard ball with your hand to send it against a wall? Yes, and it's really attractive! It is played in turns and each time the ball hits the wall, the team that serves changes. Be careful not to send it too low or too high.\n\n- Ulama\nWhat? Have you never heard of Ulama? Listen and enjoy. A traditional game in the Mayan culture that is played with the hips! Invade opponent field with the ball. In Narona you also play with your head. A huge ring on the wall means that if you pass the ball through it you get 5 points! Frankly fun!\n\nCUTE CHARACTERS\nFive girls and five boys are the brave ones who have gone out to the forests of Narona to play and have fun. With different speed, strength and jump force, each one takes advantage of its skills in each sport.

Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070243,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mild Language","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70070000023898":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/81f4c42d27f569563c5f754d2f5442ff638bc251e9958aa43545254921d023b5.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand the strategic horizons of your empire and enjoy more options for your reign with Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae VII Deluxe Edition!\n\nDeluxe Edition includes:\n\u2022 Full base game\n\u2022 Early Access - play the game early on February 6, 2025\n\u2022 Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack\n\u2022 Crossroads of the World Collection, with post-launch content featuring 2 new leaders, 4 new civilizations, 4 new wonders, a special cosmetic bonus, and more!\n\u2022 Deluxe Content Pack, which includes:\n- 2 leader personas\n- 4 profile customizations\n- 1 alternate scout skin\n\nThe award-winning strategy game franchise returns with a revolutionary new chapter.

Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles.

Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
