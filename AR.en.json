Not too long from it's closure a former employee named Bernard Jays decided to open his own movie theater a year later, and called it Bernard Cinemas. It was an absolute success! Since 2005 Bernard Cinemas became known for it's support of independent films and freshly made popcorn butter! Unfortunately during the early years of prosperity, thousands of employees who made the butter on a daily basis were infected and exposed to it's \"Poison\".\n\nInfected employees over time reported having fever, god complex, yellow skin, and yellow blood. Many have died due to complications of the Poison, but Bernard Cinemas never lost it's reputation or financial support. The hundreds of deaths did not put a dent in the company's operations. Film companies continued to flock, the wealthy continued to donate, politicians continued to protect, and the unfortunate continued to apply.\n\nEventually, in 2018 when Bernard Cinemas gained a certain billion dollar threshold, corporate finally took exertion and decided to act by creating a vaccine called \"Cell Disc\" to combat the Poison. Since then every new generation of infected employees are required to take Cell Disc. Those who were able to survive the one-hour curing process were gifted with overtime and of course free movies! As of today, the Cell Disc vaccine has retained many hard working employees from possible death, giving them a newfound purpose to live and serve Bernard Cinemas forever!\n\nXX","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ee08ef1959ca223c3325fc921ef95f085382d59f9276969fad949c65fd4a05ae.jpg","id":"0100A00025BE6000","intro":"A simple strategy board game featuring 20 different immune systems!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Extra Extra Poison NS","nsuId":70010000110079,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Butterfly","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251127,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/584f44a4a2ba9fc4e3023e2301c3b100d2dead6b1f4785812cb431e3c6721e7a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f48a20b0e5904e4125afb70c69cbd85ae831a8354823b4eba1106c5743bef4b0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f473a9138d7de58a19ae54aa715831a9f2ab1bbf92e8faa3301f0ff2b545f290.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c5af5ae1858cb05e46f31cd3e471e33de9c3af2ac8a770c6478eac54d24c705a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c501bb1c7d1048729affe27ac1a3751ef8c0b0160cb9fa7fe0580f83c9705a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/975674250e114ecf5d30562b07f10d54a6ebfb12c55184687c3c43dd7073920d.jpg"],"size":263192576,"version":null},"70010000110304":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c7a02833dfca2acfd2fe2972d597ff363e57cbb0cc3f454062dfead30f5302f9.jpg","category":["Communication","Study","Training","Education"],"description":"About the Game\nFind the hidden insects in cute and colorful illustrations!\nBy spotting the specified insect within the time limit,\nyou can enjoy a fun and easy brain-training experience.\n\nHow to Play\n\u30fbTake a good look at the insect you need to find.\n\u30fbSearch for the same insect in the illustration.\n\u30fbWhen you find it, tap the spot before time runs out!\n\nIt might look easy at first,\nbut the time limit makes it surprisingly tricky!\n\nIf you get stuck, the Hint button will gently help you out\nby showing the area where the answer is hiding.\n\nThe game supports both button controls and touch controls, allowing you to play in TV mode, handheld mode, or tabletop mode.\n\u203bThis game is designed to be played on the Nintendo Switch\u2122 in vertical orientation.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/981196eeb695c6357beed0e5ad95f483ae276cb2968a50f933c3db61283cdc52.jpg","id":"0100E8C025DB4000","intro":"Where\u2019s That Insect Hiding?\nA Cute and Easy Brain-Training Picture Hunt Game","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","ko","zh"],"name":"Where\u2019s the Insect?","nsuId":70010000110304,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"MASK","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251127,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b3a379dc3f15fb64726a3bdc98dcfc51c9a721e0ec80ea353396d12936ef9785.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/812d0d209447aa28c2203d02fd592244b343c19e482206acddb3062b3de3aa38.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f91b49f5c8c59f2a5b651fe40e0e7bb84fec28391f58c7fa88c70e478616141e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b5e804830446b1a21bf331a9284f63db1bd698d388066292d7c6ecc427bdb0ca.jpg"],"size":183500800,"version":null},"70010000110358":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3e3720b8686cb863227ed88f75166961f09762fdd3c55fb168172c4785cb9f78.jpg","category":["Lifestyle","Communication","Simulation","Utility"],"description":"In the floating world of beauty and illusion, love is the most dangerous secret of all.\nYou arrive as a stranger\u2026 but soon, one glance, one whispered word, changes everything.\n\nEach geisha hides a story  of duty, desire, and dreams long buried beneath layers of silk and silence.\nAs you grow closer, your choices will shape a fragile bond that could either blossom into forbidden love\u2026 or fade like cherry petals in the wind.\n\nWill you be the one to free her heart\u2026 or let her disappear into the shadows of tradition?\n\nHow far would you go for love that was never meant to be?\n\n\nGame Features:\n\n\u25cf Romance among the blossoms: Fall for captivating geishas, each with her own past, secrets, and emotions waiting to unfold.\n\n\u25cf Your choices decide her fate: Comfort her, challenge her, or confess your feelings.

The Bats bring with them a talent for metallurgy and a disdain for weakness, growing more resolute when their compatriots falter. \n\nMeanwhile, as smugglers grow bolder, the harsh Rocky Ravines become an option for settlers \u2013 barren lands rich in ore and minerals. Viceroys building settlements among the scraggly rocks will find themselves reliant on black market traders while mining the basalt columns that grow here in place of trees. \n\nThose seeking more verdant fields will find suitable sites among the Bamboo Flats instead. Though lush with life, the heavy rainfall erodes the loose soil, and settlers must work carefully to appease a peculiar species local to the ecosystem if they want any chance at success: the Fluffbeak. If kept happy, this beast is able to produce fertilizer, giving the local Viceroy an opportunity to plan exactly where to enrich the soil and secure the future of their settlement.\n\nNightwatchers includes:\n- Bats have little patience for weakness, having grown hardy and austere in their isolated underground halls. Fiercely devoted and stern, they bring their expertise with metals and a willingness to make sacrifices for the greater good. Once the Bats\u2019 starting ability is unlocked, you will be granted access to the Manorial Court blueprint \u2013 use it to expel a member of a chosen species, leveraging this harsh punishment to motivate all who remain to work harder in the name of the Scorched Queen.\n- The Rocky Ravine biome presents an unforgiving landscape where even the trees are made of stone, and the Black Market will be a key partner in your success \u2013 with fluctuating prices and a notable lack of wood, you\u2019ll need to leverage your plentiful stone and amber to acquire the resources needed to keep your settlement growing. But be warned \u2013 these criminals will quickly turn from merchants to miscreants, and while they present an excellent opportunity, they also expect debts to be paid in a timely manner. \n- Settle the Bamboo Flats biome with the help of an unlikely ally \u2013 though the constant rain has left these regions devoid of fertile soil, the giant Fluffbeak, if kept happy,  is able to produce copious amounts of fertilizer to help create areas of fertile soil and establish a flourishing settlement.\n- 3 new World Map Modifiers will bring harsher lands to conquer. From the Riverlands and their minimal space to places of great significance for the ancients, still watched by silent guardians that limit the number of Cornerstones that can be used.\n- 3 new World Events introduce an increasingly powerful criminal organization, explosive alchemical experiments that threaten your carefully laid-out plans, and a tree-eating beast that inadvertently opens glades and unleashes the secrets hidden within them, whether you\u2019re ready or not.\n- 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 16 new Deeds, and 6 new Decorations have been added alongside new rewards to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Bats as a playable species, you must reach level 11.\n\nPunish the meek and push forth into harsher lands in service of the Scorched Queen \u2013 with the Bats by your side, there is little room for the weak-willed.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Against the Storm - Nightwatchers","nsuId":70050000061908,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Alcohol Reference","Fantasy Violence","Language","Mild Blood","Use of Tobacco","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251204,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4a8e6a5f9ae70c810c16320832a0b0c34a756c380a346c8ebb10d20b189b3ec0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/41733e34d8c37ce0f70004eb02623452c830e32980404237225245176f3f1cd7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/696dfd68644243065e7838c9288a018ec76399458147b0b0235773fb5d24b1a3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/563c33ddb4697963ed21c17f9f92bc3ecf8ea91dd4e1edbdac4efd46708a12b2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/21a22793e82222f2b06638047cbbc66de9bdd659cb884db1f478a5e1793c7d4b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4680e84e28b9e119873419958c15e84d150095864297f842f6236642db913c06.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70050000062489":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6bc40d5d63f7139f26f29c3d0d9b82dbcbae85e2bebcd2995d39c991e665c802.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enhance your experience on Viewros with this upgrade pack.
