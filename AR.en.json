The formation of the Infinos Federation allowed for reconstruction of war-torn regions and the strengthening of defenses. But that stability shatters when an observation vessel in orbit around Graria detects a mysterious interdimensional rift\u2014then vanishes without a trace.\n\nA reconnaissance team is dispatched and uncovers a massive distortion gate erected by Argus forces, poised to launch a new offensive. Unprepared, Infinos units suffer defeat after defeat until the enemy overruns the home planet. In a bold gambit, Federation commanders decide to strike back at Argus at its source. The AT-Fauria interceptor takes off as the last line of defense and the galaxy\u2019s greatest hope.\n\nInfinos 2 is a 2D horizontal shoot \u2019em up crafted as a loving tribute to the golden age of Japanese arcade classics. Pixel-perfect art, relentless action and tight, accessible mechanics combine to deliver an experience that\u2019s instantly engaging yet rewards mastery. Each level unfolds a unique setting, fresh enemies and bosses with intricate attack patterns.\n\nEight intense levels await: above Infinos, you battle to reclaim an invaded orbital base; then around a strategic satellite; on the ravaged surface of Graria; inside a hidden Argus command outpost; through a warped dimension of giant insectoid foes and gravity anomalies; and finally three classified zones where reality itself seems to unravel for only the bravest pilots.\n\nAccessible to newcomers yet deep enough for scoring veterans, Infinos 2 balances pick-up-and-play simplicity with a steep skill ceiling. Its pixel art evokes the arcade era with modern polish, while a driving synth soundtrack heightens the drama of every firefight.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aef6bef689dd0be8924776d7c3d447e4ba818d83308e2bb0bb387b0645744093.jpg","id":"0100E2B01B6A2000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Infinos 2","nsuId":70010000067267,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PixelHeart","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251016,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/90c18fa0abe5b9e62322e79c3642d9fcad04c944614412c8702a71b5ed89adec.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ff3a358586d808d789bef75d9c789fb07d6a1bc50ac08712cec78ad68dcda6ca.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ba3f8315bd19c9e9f0c4e3fb170e11833595197af161ac12efb097bd47f8c3a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9fe1fc16a71c30f737e79a297f26983b200e8c858e865f7369589a49120d1092.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/37d075f6a16a074e67b28f382123675e96853b04618d60c44960ae9ebe241811.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2608675c1795758cdad0eeec68ae191b7323dcc9d8c8f62ed89942af9e00ba9b.jpg"],"size":373293056,"version":null},"70010000069324":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/867b6a8e16326784905fe1493bbd09800c10e0b799cea2221ebc99dbe8c604d0.jpg","category":["Arcade","Shooter"],"description":"Infinos is a pixel art side-scrolling shoot\u2019em up that pays tribute to the golden age of arcade shooters while offering fast-paced, modern gameplay.

So much so that I completely forgot I'd even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.\nNow that things have finally settled down, I\u2014Yuri Mito\u2014am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.\n\nJust as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.\n\nThis is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.\nThe Tayutama Fan Disc brings you the lovey-dovey days of a couple in love!\n\n\nMain Characters\n\u25cf Mashiro Mito, VA: Risa Matsuda\nUpon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call \"\"intense\"\", and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she's not exactly human...\nMashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that's just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.\n\n\u25cf Ameri Kawai, VA: Kaori Hanano\nThe childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She's a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro. \nShe can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she's a bit on the timid side...\n\n\u25cf Mifuyu Kisaragi, VA: Rina Misaki\nShe is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls' Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She's well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn't mean she isn't without her flaws.\nShe's rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man...\n\n\u25cf Yumina Takanashi, VA: Yu Aoto\nYumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise. Unfortunately, Mari Mito, the family matron, passes away long before the start of our story, and Yumina is ultimately adopted to the Takanashi family out of concern of a lack of mother figure.\nShe's one of those people who immediately fails at a task whenever someone is watching out of nervousness. But she doesn't mind working hard, and she's actually rather good at handling the household chores.

As the galaxy's (soon to be) premiere chef, it's up to you to seek out the finest ingredients from alien planets, cook delicious dishes, and serve them to customers in the comfort of your fully-customisable space trailer.\n\nExplore Alien Worlds\nThere's a whole universe of ingredients out there... if they don't eat you first. Explore distant planets, derelict space stations, and your own basement for plants, critters, and other tasty morsels.\n\nAlong the way, you'll come across space pirates, ancient ruins, and a suspiciously high number of recently abandoned restaurants. Keep an eye out for rare resources (and bits of random junk) that you can use to upgrade your gear, kitchen equipment, and spaceship.\n\nCook Up Cosmic Creations\nOnce your fridge is stocked with ingredients that have (mostly) stopped wriggling, it's time to flip the sign and start serving!\n\nCraft over 140 different dishes, from simple homestyle Beefle Skewers to the legendarily tricky Octoegg Surprise. Wow your customers with delicious food and speedy service, and you\u2019ll earn the Astronomical Culinary Excellence Stars that mark your path to intergalactic culinary success.\n\nAs your reputation grows, the customers start coming to you! Keep it flexible by continuing your delivery service or open up a sit-in restaurant with a constant flow of patrons. You're free to close the kitchen whenever adventure calls.\n\nSet a Stellar Ambiance\nYour space-trailer might not look too sharp from the outside, but she's got it where it counts. Take complete control of your interior with freely placeable decorations and an in-depth coloring system to create the restaurant of your dreams. Add new floors, create themed zones, and fill it with the furniture and props you find on your travels!\u00a0\n\nServe the Nebula\nThe citizens of the Horseshoe Nebula are more than just hungry bellies (most of them, anyway). Get to know Zoe the scrap dealer, faded Space Ace Jack Bronzon, the definitely-not-alien barman Zlurka, and many more characters on your journey to interstellar culinary stardom. Unique recipes, side quests, and even romance awaits if you can satisfy your loyal customers.\n\nWith your new-found friends, you\u2019ll uncover the truth about your missing grandma and take on the might of Galactic Burger as they try to muscle in on your space-turf.\n\nSpace Chef features:\n- Over 140 delectable dishes to create from 100+ alien ingredients\n- 5 alien planets to explore, from the jungle-filled Lush to aquatic Bluegoonia\n- 180+ creatures and plants to hunt, harvest, and run away from\n- 100+ craftable items for your character, ship, and kitchen\n- 150+ furnishings and decorations to personalize your restaurant\n- Freedom to create your own menu, opening times, and service style \u2013 vegetarian and vegan included!\n- A zany cast of characters, including romanceable NPCs with their own favorite recipes and questlines\n- A thrilling story of adventure, betrayal, and mass-produced burgers","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/841efe2d524a5f55f4749013c17571cb735f833dad91726b1c745b157ce19df0.jpg","id":"0100E37023538000","intro":"Hunt, cook, and deliver cosmic cuisine to become the greatest chef in the nebula!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Space Chef","nsuId":70010000097068,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Kwalee","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Mild Fantasy Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251028,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9ee830e98d21837c3eaea4c5bab3c8d223a6f5bf6e87cfcb182d61536874f27b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/77888611160afa1dcd5254638b852bc12a7eb03653d356e167f77d92ff89c16f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b8c568ac6125680cfd175636582a0eaab04f8ebd7f6e7e91f17472db9bbde1c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9a9629b7aa196ebc08dbbe721453f34cad2138832eeb12b8afeb473a32b678f8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e27281fa76a383eaa1339468510798d2c592c09095afe9b24b7fc5f84ad3be1c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e6de314305aed4aa10996701f01312d4652e5f6d4fa23ab142a8a023175cd98e.jpg"],"size":1153433600,"version":null},"70010000094762":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2bbb5673a82170af9ded1ce80ce8b12c0c7463b9720738c56cf40dee945b6e9f.jpg","category":["Platformer","Arcade","Action","Adventure"],"description":"Step into the arcade-era thrill of Halloween 1985!\n\nWhen monsters steal Pumpkman\u2019s pumpkins on Halloween night, it\u2019s up to you to get them back!

Explore beautifully crafted arenas inspired by Achilles: Legends Untold - from the walls of Troy to windswept Greek coastlines.\n\nDEFEAT YOUR ENEMIES... OR DIE TRYING\nAchilles has never faced monsters like this - and now it\u2019s your turn. Dive into chaotic, action-packed runs and hold your ground against relentless waves of enemies. Pick from dozens of powers and transform them mid-run in the Forge.\n\nThe deeper you go, the tougher it gets. No two runs are the same - and surviving means adapting fast.\n\nBUILD LIKE A STRATEGOS\nDrop flame turrets, raise healing shrines, or summon Myrmidons to fight at your side.

Learn their patterns, adapt your build, and survive escalating waves until it\u2019s time to face an Overlord.\n\nThese bosses don\u2019t wait for you to get ready - they\u2019ll punish weak strategies and reward smart structure placement.\n\nGET STRONGER WITH EVERY RUN\nDeath isn\u2019t failure - it\u2019s part of your path. Complete challenges to unlock new characters, earn treasures and Favors, and improve your stats with long-term upgrades.\n\nThe further you push, the more power you bring into your next run.\n\nEXPLORE ANCIENT GREECE\nReturn to the world of Achilles: Legends Untold and slay them all!\n\nBattle across mythical arenas drawn from Greek legend, such as Troy and the sun-scorched coasts of Greece.
