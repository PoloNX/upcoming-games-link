Every battle scales based on the number of players involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough!\n\nWith a highly customisable class system, Stolen Realm allows you to create traditional RPG classes or break the mold to forge a unique champion of your own as you draw from a pool of hundreds of possible skills. Make a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost, or a shadow-infused knight. Further customize your build by earning and reforging loot that truly changes the way you play: wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you, or unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. D&D-like events where attribute-based rolls will have permanent effects on your character add yet another layer to building a character that is truly your own. Anything is possible in this title that keeps compelling choices at the forefront of your experience.\n\nKeeping the core appeal of RPGs at its forefront, Stolen Realm ensures you spend all your time, fighting, building your characters and making compelling choices that determine your immediate path or effect your character, rather than getting bogged down in side quests and other RPG-bloat. After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each procedurally generated adventure. If you\u2019re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with 6 different difficulty levels \u2013 or pick Hardcore Mode with permadeath, where every battle can be the last!\n\nAlso features Roguelike Mode, a fast paced version of the game where you can mix and match builds that are simply not possible in the traditional campaign!\n\nCarve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honor and glory in the battlefield.

Unleash your skills across these diverse landscapes, transforming them into manicured canvases with the rhythmic hum of your trusty mowing blades.\n\nREAL-WORLD LICENSED MOWER BRANDS\nThe original licensed lawn mower brands of Toro, SCAG, STIGA, and EGO have been re-created in a visually and physically stunning way.

A lone island, sitting in the middle of an endless ocean, and the site of a magical phenomenon known only as the Rift.

The Ateyan disappeared, becoming motes of light on an almost deserted island. Human civilizations crumbled, its formerly great cities and industry reclaimed by nature. Generations passed in the shadow of ancient splendor. Then, something happened: The Rift began consuming the island, threatening the survival of humanity's remnants.\n\nMonster Tribe puts you in the shoes of humanity's last hope, a sage born with a natural connection to the Ateyan, capable of calling them forth from the void between the real world and the Rift.

This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time, you can move things around, connect things, flip things, to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, others by touching, pushing, or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected to function. For example, for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be attached to a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nTo rid the levels of the monsters! The simplest way is to push the monster off the edge of a platform and make it fall off the screen. You could cut the rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pull a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.\n\nKey Features\n\u2022 Solve over 500 wacky puzzles form each game across 5 different worlds.\n\u2022 Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n\u2022 Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing line pegs.\n\u2022 Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7bb4cebe0f8d56c89b14b7ab5d0abf1d771fe21cc29e2c1e934f76b6d647a8cd.jpg","id":"010031E01DBB6000","intro":"Contraptions is a physics-based puzzle game with a fun cartoony look.

Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor. Your skills, your tames, your weapons and your builds -- everything that you\u2019ve accomplished is put to the test here, as the future of humanity hangs in the balance!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Emerge into a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in extensive story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"ARK: Genesis Part 2","nsuId":70050000036384,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Snail Games USA","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Blood","Crude Humor","Use of Alcohol","Violence","Users Interact"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240530,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000040082":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8c57465cee620457eaa1fafbbc2d32013c51662b1a343b4d2cf3f29d4cfc9512.jpg","category":null,"description":"Experience more from LEGO 2K Drive with the Season 4 Drive Pass.\n\nBonus content is only accessible by the Nintendo Account used for purchasing this content.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Season 4 Drive Pass","nsuId":70050000040082,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"2K","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Fantasy Violence","Users Interact","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240531,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":0,"version":null},"70050000047503":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c5c545553a32293bade0ef31b5afe3b12ba97934ccf6f50d543ff566ee5816c8.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enjoy three new game modes: \"Original,\" \"Time Limit,\" and \"Attack.\"\n\n\"Original\" is the usual Suika Game, and the player with the highest score wins.
