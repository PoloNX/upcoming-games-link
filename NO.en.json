In this game, the player character enters his inner world through a psychotherapeutic machine. He is turned into an odd-looking biological machine and searches for a way to escape from that world. Because of its unique world setting, it is described as one of the top 3 warped games or bizarre games.\n\nIt is basically a mystery-solving exploratory adventure game. But it also has many RPG elements such as character development through body modifications and intricate fishing system. And the story questions the ambiguity of escaping from the world and staying in the world.\n\nOne of the features of Garage is its detailed world building. Elements like energy circulation, ecosystem and how the world came about are intertwined tightly, and are reflected in the game system, bringing to life the feel of the deep another world. The unique feeling of strangeness and anxiety surrounding the whole game, even though it is not a horror or depressing game, is created by these settings and system.\n\nIn this remastered version, almost all images have been retouched, videos have been revised using AI frame interpolation, user-interface and game balance have been improved, and new chapters, subquests and multiple endings have been added.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/302074bbcbfabfeaeb0aecd42fd5090aa4e351d1a402f911125f7e941b2d624d.jpg","id":"010012201F2EE000","intro":"You are thrown into a weird world by the machine Garage.

Or explore the original story told in Shin Megami Tensei V, the \"Canon of Creation\" \u2013 an eternal conflict between angels and demons, in which the protagonist fights for the world\u2019s fate. \n\nWhen a grisly murder scene in modern-day Tokyo blocks our protagonist\u2019s walk home, an unplanned detour leaves him buried and unconscious. He awakens in a new Tokyo, a wasteland ravaged by apocalypse now called Da\u2019at\u2026 but before bloodthirsty demons can claim his life, a savior emerges, and the two of them unite to become a mighty being, neither human nor demon: a Nahobino. \n\nWith newfound power, the protagonist ventures through Da'at, an enigmatic realm filled with mythical deities and demonic tyrants in constant conflict for survival. Searching for answers, the protagonist must forge his own path in a battle between angels and demons to dictate the fate of the world. \n \nKEY FEATURES \n\nThe Definitive Version of Shin Megami Tensei V \n\nFully evolved with stunning visuals for modern consoles, the dark lore, unnerving atmosphere, and beautiful and monstrous demons are back and better than ever. Massively expanded with new areas, demons, and music, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance features more accessible gameplay, an improved battle system, new demon experiences, and greater field exploration. \n\nA Tale of Vengeance or Creation \n\nWhich path will you choose? Experience a brand-new tale of revenge by the fallen or the original story of Shin Megami Tensei V, both filled with conflicting and tragic choices, forcing you to confront which ideologies you are willing to fight for.

Created in a hand-drawn and collage art style reminiscent of cozy picture books, it presents a harbor populated with surprising creatures such as the scrapcrabs and the bobcat kittens, but also yummy \u201cmousemallows\u201d. \n\nThe SOLO adventure is suitable for young children on their own thanks to specific accessibility features. It doesn\u2019t require knowing how to read and can be played with a touch screen. With short gameplay stages that enable trial and error, Mouse & Crane befits different skill and experience levels.\nIn this mode, players control Crane\u2019s arm. They start with just a hook to transport things like containers or Mouse himself, and progressively discover various upgrades such as a giant magnet to grab metal scraps and tools, or a wrecking ball for the most satisfying demolitions!\n\nMouse & Crane also shines in CO-OP with the child and parent (or an older sibling) working creatively together to solve puzzles that can't be completed alone, sharing digital moments. In this mode, one player plays as Crane while the other can make Electryna move and jump with fun motion controls, helping Mouse get new tools... Electryna\u2019s swiftness and electric powers are a delight. \n\nThe game is produced by two studios from Denmark and Canada that are experienced in creating meaningful and wholesome experiences for children. Mouse & Crane shows the power of cooperation, creativity, upcycling and DIY crafting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/edebd27aec7891069ed63eea7d40cca030da96448656e9da56f491653a8c93a2.jpg","id":"010053B01F3F4000","intro":"Ideal as a child\u2019s first game, Mouse & Crane is a single or multiplayer adventure offering creative puzzle-solving moments through cooperation, upcycling and construction.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","fr"],"name":"Mouse & Crane","nsuId":70010000081606,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Those Eyes","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240621,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80313b5718caa9689f6784baa1e9939bde5d156405ebf5af158a53288f6a3eef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e71e9873c7c6bf6cf72a09ff0bcf89a1116625c3ce5fc402ee972030229608a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8ae08d6ff3261ac3b415fa359840e416a02d716617ed12adff48777bcb84b61b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2beae13defe99ee9ce700941dd2e72a750ab63c3534cc60c37c51d1463c5a0de.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/235fb000bb0be96019cd24cded7dcea3686b60d7fa155e98484970b7e565d717.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc99a435a31b4b8387c1a0021521935b3cfee1b513a6a405e9c4d80725ac044a.jpg"],"size":776994816,"version":null},"70010000081052":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/05a6c93a26ce7d33c8d0ab1281e4d15ea0ceb305090e4d4c8ce282ba38a86833.jpg","category":["Arcade","Action","Adventure","Simulation"],"description":"Control the hungry snake on the hunt for food to grow longer and bigger.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
