These beasts, known as Kemono, embody the very essence of nature in all its beauty and ferocity. The key to surviving the fight lies in joining forces with comrades and wielding Karakuri technology.\n\n\u2022 Develop your hunting grounds using Karakuri technology.\nWeaving the threads of Karakuri enables you to instantly create basic items like crates and gliders. You can even combine these items to develop Karakuri like beast-piercing blades, protective shields, and traps to stop movement in real time, all of which can aid you in your battle against the Kemono. There are also some Karakuri that will remain on the field, giving you the freedom to place them in strategic locations and create your own ideal hunting grounds.\n\n\u2022 Customize your play experience with diverse combat styles.\nThe game features a wide range of equipment. From general weapons like the nodachi and bow, to unconventional ones like the karakuri katana and bladed wagasa, each weapon has unique characteristics. By utilizing materials gathered from the hunts to craft new equipment, hunters can persist in their pursuit of beasts. This ongoing cycle enables hunters to grow even stronger and challenge themselves in combat against numerous fearsome Kemono.\n\n\u2022 The story and world:\nNo one remembers why the Kemono began their rampage through a once-prosperous Azuma. Fueled by desperation, they wield the power of primal nature at its most destructive. For a while, it seemed that none could stand against their overwhelming might.

Across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d of anime-inspired adventure, Ringo and Wolfe will have to work together to find answers, make up for past mistakes, and travel across the universe in search of their goal. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll learn how to get along at some point!\n\nTrained in the ways of Kiai, a magical form of martial art and also the universe\u2019s most exciting form of televised entertainment, Ringo can combine words to create customized attacks in intense turn-based battles. Defeat or befriend a cast of fearsome space pirates, mysterious scoundrels, cute witches, high school delinquents, talking crows, and skilled martial artists on your way to becoming a Kiai master.\n\nUSE YOUR WORDS\nCreate custom attacks by combining words up to the limit of your spirit level. The more spirit you have, the more slots you have to place words into and the more powerful and complex actions you can take.\n\nAll words have cool downs and opponents might be weak or strong against specific attacks or specific elements. You won\u2019t know which until you engage them in battle so you need to be prepared to improvise.\n\nCOLLECT THEM ALL\nWith over 200 words to collect across the game there is a near infinite number of possible unique attacks to make. As you expand Ringo\u2019s vocabulary you\u2019ll need to carefully select which words you take into battle, building strategies around your mix of categories, blend of offensive and defensive words, giving yourself options to manage your opponents weaknesses and strengths, consider optimizing the juggling of cool downs and, of course, which attacks sound the coolest.\n\nThe result is an accessible, immediately fun but deep combat system.\n\nSTEP UP WITH PEP UPS\nThe core ethos of the Kiai martial art is to fight with honor. Defeating an opponent with honor can turn the most heated of rivals into the fastest of friends! Befriend your rivals to earn their words of encouragement in the form of useful Pep Ups which can be equipped to give you special bonuses in combat.\n\nTHE STARS CALL\nTravel the universe on a rollercoaster adventure as you seek the pieces of the Wanderstar map, Ringo\u2019s lost brother and the answers to Wolfe\u2019s mysterious past.\n\nUNLIKELY ALLIES\nAlong the way you\u2019ll build a found family of colorful characters, each with their own thing going on. They might not all get along at first, but that\u2019s nothing a thrilling space adventure can\u2019t fix! And even with the trail gone cold, take heart, for these wandering stars are bound to find each other...\n\nAN ANIME YOU CAN PLAY\nInspired by anime the developers grew up watching, Wander Stars plays out across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d, each one taking between 60-90 minutes to complete. Each episode features a map to explore with procedurally generated battles, special events and other secrets to find along with the main story events.\n\nPlay an episode at a time, or binge the whole thing in one go! You can even replay episodes to find all the side adventures, NPCs, and party member banter you might have missed! Try new paths as you explore ever-changing maps with randomized special events, lurking rivals, and tantalizing treasures.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
