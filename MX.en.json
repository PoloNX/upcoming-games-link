Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the height of human-powered transport technology: the all-terrain Bike!\nYour trusty BMX is one touch of a button away at any time. Move around the map faster, access new areas, launch it at enemies, and perform sick bike tricks to gain bonuses.\n\nHack and slash your enemies with the obligatory machete or shoot them with the Kid\u2019s choc-full-of-mayhem Turbo Glove\u2122. Turbo Blast, Electric Shocks, circular saws\u2026 use the array of weapons at your disposal to slash, rip apart, or explode enemies into hysterical and over-the-top splashes of gore!\n\nA BMX-powered pixel-art Metroidvania gore-fest based on the film Turbo Kid.\nOur story begins immediately after the movie ends. On your journey, you will meet weirdos and oddballs, some friends, some foes, and some in-between, who will offer advice, quests, fights, and jokes (lots of jokes) in a heartfelt and hysterical story created in collaboration with the filmmakers behind the movie.\n\nExplore the different zones and defeat bosses in the order you see fit, make choices that will affect the course of the story, allowing for multiple playthroughs with different paths and outcomes.\n\nIf you don\u2019t care about the story and you\u2019re only in it for the gameplay (speedrun afficionados, we\u2019re looking at you), all the dialogue is skippable.\nMany cutscenes can simply be ignored if you don't wish to interact with them.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4b5835cf55df786d373480790d2da01132c26080f6c0eddd38fd8b7620160d78.jpg","id":"010094001DB1C000","intro":"A nostalgic metroidvania adventure with insane weapons, skills, and pixel gore.

Fear not, that\u2019s why Arcana Constructs are there to do all your magical gardening for you!

Are you a sucker for a world of monsters and magic?\n\nDo you like wholesale violence peppered with coarse language, and served with a side of pixelated booty?\n\nThen buckle up, you legend. We're going for a ride...\n\nGet ready to travel far and wide, taking on creatures of all shapes and sizes in classic turn-based fashion, while discovering the secrets and adventures that Allegoria has in store.\n\nHarvest the body parts of your adversaries for financial gain and personal satisfaction, level up to strike down even greater foes, and arm yourself with more weapons and equipment than any sane person could be reasonably expected to carry on their person at any given time.\n\nThere are more than 144 unique enemies to face on your adventures through Allegoria, from ferocious Canadian geese and majestic tortoises to your bog-standard fantasy staples like dragons, unicorns, and the ever-ubiquitous slimes! There are plenty of beasts and beyond to encounter, each with unique item drops that can be sold in shops for the gold you'll need to purchase weapons and equipment to aid you on your journey.\n\nHave you ever played a game that has one weapon you just can't put down, or an armor set that makes you indestructible? It's a great feeling, isn't it?\n\nToo bad that's not the case here.\n\nIn Allegoria, if you want to get stronger, you'll need to master as much equipment as you can if you want to increase your stats, and if you think you need new attacks or magic spells to bring with you into battle, you'd better replace that old gear with something new, and fast. With more than 80 skills to learn and almost 150 pieces of equipment to collect, you'll want to try them all to find the right move set for you!\n\nThere's no shortage of personality in Allegoria, and everyone seems to have something to say. Most of it's just fluff to fill in empty spaces and make the world seem more lifelike, but every once in a while, someone actually has something useful to say.\n\nThey may be a little rough around the edges, but the people of Allegoria are always willing to guide you on your journey, and they might even have a quest or two for you to earn gold and other helpful items.\n\nThere's a story in there somewhere... it's just buried under layers of madness and debauchery.\n\nIf you think grinding for experience and mastering weapons is tedious, try to unravel this Gordian knot of a narrative.\n\nDoes it have a deeper meaning?

But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset. \n\nExperienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!\nTeams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!\n\nWAYS TO PLAY\nPlay solo or online. Be tethered together in local or online Co-Op. Race your friends in local Splitscreen. Enjoy the chaos of Fling to the Finish in a way that fits you.\n\nCOURSES!\nEvery course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next. \n\nATTACKS!\nOpponents battle back with hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers if they fall behind. Our items keep the races interesting, and help even the score if one player has more experience than another.  \n\nSHARE A CONTROLLER\nBecause you're literally attached to your partner, Fling to the Finish is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through Fling to the Finish by sharing a controller with your partner. \nThis control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game.

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era.

It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","pt","en","fr","de","zh","zh"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086482,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000046105":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df5e52844738f32f17e1654480187020ced34f51e902672540af805ea857719d.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7026","ids":["0100FBD013AB7026"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner -
