Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end \u2013 but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\n\nBUILD AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF CITIES\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/826e32bcdd2337d3db30beb6ee97a0f412b77c8fbad04dfc2ecbdb12ee50cd90.jpg","id":"010062F01F2CC000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Against the Storm","nsuId":70010000081349,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Referencia al alcohol","Violencia de fantasia","Lenguaje","Bajo contenido de sangre","Uso de tabaco","Compras dentro del juego"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aaca9d684f2e362c492feee0f8fa2a79eac58e785d61b7cd149b2d85325147dc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc7fb0bdb90a3cd2683264a45f728f7fbf765bdcdbb02feafb5120222eb3f5e2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/13a5eb288f4ea7779a33e79ac94e6b3b4afca1cd459feb2172f974c3dda7a7f5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3e6fd272cd6df26d63ac4ad4ac59553798e05ec1e9940bfc59b569d4e43fff20.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7502b7d812d79066d263bf8b9289e299a647113e0b83b052e32ddc499c331f6a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cf8ed8d8dad38075a8a6344e3debaa6f5e10a67d415cce340055b964d6894dc6.jpg"],"size":2134900736,"version":null},"70010000086104":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2b6ec6da96eb4205ae023b9e52d03072586b6a079fbe8783b79c88a6c2b2527a.jpg","category":["Shooter","Action"],"description":"Imperial year 248.\n\nThe empire is in the midst of deteriorating security, hopeless diplomatic relations, and endless war.

Meanwhile, unique opportunities present themselves in the once-thriving forests left barren by the march of industry \u2013 the Ashen Thicket is littered with broken trunks and remnants of a past age, awaiting a masterful Viceroy to restore its forgotten glory.\n\nAgainst the Storm - Keepers of the Stone includes:\n- Welcome the dignified Frogs to your settlements and take advantage of their proficiency with stone masonry, the comfort they take in rainwater, and their ability to increase the rate at which new citizens join your settlements.\n- Explore the new Coastal Grove biome where settlements start along the water, far from the easy reach of royal envoys and the benefits they provide. Rely instead on the Strider Port building \u2013 unique to the Coastal Grove biome, it allows you to launch expeditions seeking treasures buried in the surrounding waters. The Strider Port offers a fresh way to seek out new building designs with each expedition simply requiring a supply of food for the Water Strider and its rider alike \u2013 the more you\u2019re willing to invest in supplies, the better your potential finds might be.\n- Brave the new Ashen Thicket biome, ravaged by industrial exploitation and the Blightstorm alike. The barren lands here are home to the rare Thunderblight Shards \u2013 lightning-infused crystals that can be mined at great cost, crucial for forging Cornerstones using the Ashen Thicket\u2019s unique Cornerstone Forge building. With only a limited number of opportunities to produce your own Cornerstones, you must strategically choose which conditions and rewards go hand-in-hand, with the option to take on penalties in the hopes of bolstering their benefit.\n- New rewards are added to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City to benefit the new Frog species alongside 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 1 new Epic Cornerstone, 3 new Rare perks, and 5 new Uncommon perks.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Frogs as a playable species, you must reach level 9.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"010062F01F2CD001","ids":["010062F01F2CD001"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Against the Storm - Keepers of the Stone","nsuId":70050000056100,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Referencia al alcohol","Violencia de fantasia","Lenguaje","Bajo contenido de sangre","Uso de tabaco","Compras dentro del juego"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f8f9d0fafe7fdf346fb6e94becd111ceb04d69cce21ca266ad3b7eaacb8edcca.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/20f1324c8c52a4033714815173337b2dedbe3548da6bd34cd9e7fc355c591d18.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e530107176554b65628cdfe449d36986f3c67e3c452698bd011c5025d0757335.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6fb7dde72ff848922c69f6c80a868f80be58be49af7ee564fa741c8424d50af0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/eab4adeaf08e09fb0d5b7ecc4b3ab4658c4ead633770bbc6a5c3ccb763bd399c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6729fe301aa4502772875bfa6620b9037da52e0e8e5f16b1fd0c55b8411d93ee.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000056190":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a2e0ca99a83822d414d86e1f4433d73afc2946b226a48457d86c3e60e0b8a794.jpg","category":null,"description":"This DLC unlocks a brand new world for hexceed: Flavum! \nPuzzle your way through 145 brand-new levels!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Unlocks a new world for hexceed: Flavum brings 145 new puzzles and includes all mechanics from the previous DLC.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Flavum","nsuId":70050000056190,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"ToastieLabs","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7b53b18da29033fb288a86e03224ba2c04c900150b071b89a514456d33ded0c9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8f6c21729e48026153c9f0b05a032b99ba5dbb037a851a59c207b6c45a6979b8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ba45b1606fac22889cd25aeebaa06044e1f745fd4441b4be1312745539d1763f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/01004865980160bbd135e4cbf5dc1f57547da7762f26b870fd689898d95993af.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d7336384e8a2fc585c4bb71c89dd5e9ceabdaf8e3ae012f2424323f60267cf1b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/50f67cc8179bb567155c1090b5d581038461b879d7a48d6872e11e33699a4271.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000058361":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/367d541def0931621cc277036993f878b39fe3e6518ba1ddf28c13569c3f6e48.jpg","category":null,"description":"Extend your collection and design rooms with twenty new items.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Create your dream room and make it truly yours","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Cottagecore","nsuId":70050000058361,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"REDDEER.GAMES","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9cac34ff4e56769302c01bb635a5e354b31f513123ad763b490691a180149ff9.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000058448":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7522ed63fa85e2676faa88fdf0897bff60c06b4289af58e00cae8ce13e1f77aa.jpg","category":null,"description":"Extend your collection and design rooms with twenty new items.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Create your dream room and make it truly yours","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Mediterranean","nsuId":70050000058448,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"REDDEER.GAMES","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/448888ae6cf7f53e9c0eb1e5c150e8a39d029e0ad58af1e82929e9d301650df6.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70070000028826":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/158233b81704dd913fc1660d74efefd7de8d47c84bacd15bf71087909eaa2ff5.jpg","category":null,"description":"Description: My Cozy Room is a relaxing sandbox game where you can design and decorate your very own spaces.

Across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d of anime-inspired adventure, Ringo and Wolfe will have to work together to find answers, make up for past mistakes, and travel across the universe in search of their goal. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll learn how to get along at some point!\n\nTrained in the ways of Kiai, a magical form of martial art and also the universe\u2019s most exciting form of televised entertainment, Ringo can combine words to create customized attacks in intense turn-based battles. Defeat or befriend a cast of fearsome space pirates, mysterious scoundrels, cute witches, high school delinquents, talking crows, and skilled martial artists on your way to becoming a Kiai master.\n\nUSE YOUR WORDS\nCreate custom attacks by combining words up to the limit of your spirit level. The more spirit you have, the more slots you have to place words into and the more powerful and complex actions you can take.\n\nAll words have cool downs and opponents might be weak or strong against specific attacks or specific elements. You won\u2019t know which until you engage them in battle so you need to be prepared to improvise.\n\nCOLLECT THEM ALL\nWith over 200 words to collect across the game there is a near infinite number of possible unique attacks to make. As you expand Ringo\u2019s vocabulary you\u2019ll need to carefully select which words you take into battle, building strategies around your mix of categories, blend of offensive and defensive words, giving yourself options to manage your opponents weaknesses and strengths, consider optimizing the juggling of cool downs and, of course, which attacks sound the coolest.\n\nThe result is an accessible, immediately fun but deep combat system.\n\nSTEP UP WITH PEP UPS\nThe core ethos of the Kiai martial art is to fight with honor.
