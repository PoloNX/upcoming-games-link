He and his sons left for war 150 years ago against the TRADDESS and ZOOGT empires, lightyears away from SHINORUBI.\n\nThe kingdom was entrusted to five generals close to the royal family, under the command of the king's only daughter: NEMEZIYA BA\u00c4A.\n\nNight falls on KADDIN, the capital... The endless night before the solstice of BA\u00c4A's thousand-year rule. Eight mercenaries will try the impossible under cover of night: overthrow the kingdom.\n\nSHINORUBI packs a great arcade action punch with great replayability thanks to its numerous difficulty levels, arranged modes, and player ships.\n\nThe only part of your ship vulnerable to enemy shots is the center. Better avoid the myriad of missiles and bullets aiming for you and destroy everything between you and your target!\n\nThere is only one rule: Do not die... and destroy the BA\u00c4A kingdom.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- HD graphics taking you through 5 awe-inspiring environments, between futuristic forests, military bases and stormy skies; \n- 5 difficulty modes, from super easy to very hard, for a variety of challenges!\n- 8 playable ships, with varied POWER, SPEED and SHOT COVER stats to adapt to your playstyle;\n- 12 \"arranged\" modes: play against the clock in \"Caravan Mode\", take risks in \"Shield\" mode, test your stamina in \"Journey\" mode or catch pigs in \"Pink Pig Mode\"!\n- A BOSS RUSH mode with three difficulty levels!",

    "description": "Inspired By the Classics, Made for the 21st Century\nChallenging platform parkour inspired by classic SEGA games of the 90s - The Jungle Book, Aladdin, Lion King \u2013 but with modern twists and ideas. Platform parkour through the remains of humanity. Outwit evolved wildlife and dangerous hybrid flora. Crack environmental puzzles that keep you guessing. And stay one step ahead of the wicked humans who are pursuing you in a twisted apocalyptic safari hunt.\n\nThe Story of a Hunted Cub\nAfter the Great Ecological Catastrophe, the ultrarich flee to Mars and leave the rest to perish. But among them a small child who developed immunity to the hostile planet remains. Decades pass and those on Mars venture back to Earth to do recon. When they spot a small human child, The Cub, they immediately try to capture it. This sets off a journey of escape, exploration and discovery through the urban ruins of humanity coupled with frantic cat and mouse chases.\n\nThis World Tells Tales\nExplore the ruins of humanity after the Great Ecological Catastrophe wipes out most of the civilization and leaves our remains to be reclaimed by an evolved mother nature. The story and clues of how and why humanity fell is strewn throughout the world. Crumbling brutalist tower blocks and abandoned genetics labs. Depleted chemical mines and overgrown battlefields. Each level has a story to tell.\n\nThe Perfect Tunes to Keep You Company\nAccompanying you on the journey is Radio Nostalgia From Mars, a custom soundtrack that\u2019ll crash land into your psyche. Sink into thought-provoking survivor stories from the few ultrarich living on Mars, while a smooth-voiced radio DJ keeps the show moving with a collection of chill apocalypse-wave tunes.\n\nIf Looks Could Bring Back Memories\nMeticulously drawn and stylized to look like the classic animated films of the late 90s - Atlantis, Tarzan, Road to El Dorado - while also taking a page from Samurai Jack\u2019s creator Genndy Tartakovsky critically acclaimed series, Primal.",

He doesn't know when the expedition began, and why it still can't reach its goal. One thing he knows for sure is that since they're stuck here for a while, he should find himself a girl. And he's got just the right one in mind.\n\nFrequent encounters in the wardroom, lunches together with the whole crew... the task seems a piece of cake. But there are three catches. First, the girl is as cold and unfriendly like cosmic ice. The second one, she's obsessed with exploring abandoned alien ruins, hidden beneath the planet's cloud cover. And the third one, the empty ruins have begun to respond to her.\n\nFeatures:\n- Studio Wirion's signature sci-fi story continues the tradition, established by the studio's previous project, the visual novel Athanasy; - Wirion's calling card - the niche \u00abbiopunk\u00bb genre;\n- a soundtrack specially made for the game by the duo Synthelligence, describing their genre of their music as \u00abmelodic sci-fi\u00bb;\n- professional artists and designers have created an incredible world, based on plant technology;\n- As expected of Wirion's distinctive style, this adult and daring story embraces the ideas, that are based on actual scientific research.",

Explore a dangerous, minimalist world, armed with simple two button controls: tap a button to change direction diagonally by 45 degrees, and hold down a button to unleash a cathartic dash forward. That\u2019s all you need to solve environmental puzzles and labyrinthine levels. Around each corner is a new challenge that will test your two-button and problem-solving skills. A variety of difficult enemies and bosses help you mark your time as you navigate through 30 levels spread across four worlds.\n\nqomp2 effectively captures the essence of the original 1972 Pong and its spiritual successor, the 2021 experimental indie title qomp.\n\nKey Features:\n\nCerebral Puzzling: The simple, two button controls belie complex and compelling gameplay. Use your reflexes and think ahead to avoid hazards, flip switches, and bounce your way through 30 tricky levels. Hidden collectibles push you to explore every inch of the minimalist maps.\n\nA Surprise around Every Corner: qomp2 constantly delights as new features, mechanics, enemies, traps and hazards are introduced as you progress deeper into the game. Don\u2019t get complacent: As soon as you\u2019ve mastered one aspect of gameplay, another is ready to challenge you.\n\nBosses: Four challenging bosses block your path at the end of each world. You will need to use all your newfound skills to master their attacks and defenses. Don\u2019t worry. Death isn\u2019t the end in an arcade-inspired world.  Quick respawn makes sure you\u2019re back in the action in seconds.\n\nA Serene Soundscape: A soundtrack of ambient jams gets you in the groove, and helps you keep your cool, as you work your way through the minimalist maze.\n\nAn Emotional Journey: An enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly through simple effects and gameplay.",

    "description": "A grieving boy begins to read a Bantu tale written by his late father. Adventure into the beautiful and treacherous lands of Kenzera as Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness. With your cosmic powers and untried courage, you advance into unknown mythological lands. Once bursting with life, Kenzera is now rife with lost ancestral spirits. As Zau advances toward his goal, three mighty beings lie in wait, fearsome in their strength yet somehow strangely familiar. Will you embrace the dance of the shaman?\n\nEmbark on a poignant single-player story shaped by actor Abubakar Salim\u2019s own experience with grief,  discovering how love gives us the courage to press on after devastating loss. Wield powers from the Sun and the Moon to defeat restless spirits in rhythmic combat and become a worthy Nganga: a spiritual healer. Discover a rich universe with untold lore of chaos & order and journey through mystical 2.5D realms awash with colour and depth, emboldened by multi-award-winning composer Nainita Desai's enchanting original score.\n\nCrafted by Surgent Studios, the entertainment studio founded by actor Abubakar Salim (Assassin's Creed: Origins, Raised by Wolves) and published by EA Originals, Tales of Kenzera\u2122: ZAU takes you on a thrilling emotional journey inspired by the rich myths of Bantu cultures.\n",
