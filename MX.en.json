The key to surviving the fight lies in joining forces with comrades and wielding Karakuri technology.\n\n\u2022 Develop your hunting grounds using Karakuri technology.\nWeaving the threads of Karakuri enables you to instantly create basic items like crates and gliders. You can even combine these items to develop Karakuri like beast-piercing blades, protective shields, and traps to stop movement in real time, all of which can aid you in your battle against the Kemono. There are also some Karakuri that will remain on the field, giving you the freedom to place them in strategic locations and create your own ideal hunting grounds.\n\n\u2022 Customize your play experience with diverse combat styles.\nThe game features a wide range of equipment. From general weapons like the nodachi and bow, to unconventional ones like the karakuri katana and bladed wagasa, each weapon has unique characteristics. By utilizing materials gathered from the hunts to craft new equipment, hunters can persist in their pursuit of beasts. This ongoing cycle enables hunters to grow even stronger and challenge themselves in combat against numerous fearsome Kemono.\n\n\u2022 The story and world:\nNo one remembers why the Kemono began their rampage through a once-prosperous Azuma.

Across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d of anime-inspired adventure, Ringo and Wolfe will have to work together to find answers, make up for past mistakes, and travel across the universe in search of their goal. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll learn how to get along at some point!\n\nTrained in the ways of Kiai, a magical form of martial art and also the universe\u2019s most exciting form of televised entertainment, Ringo can combine words to create customized attacks in intense turn-based battles. Defeat or befriend a cast of fearsome space pirates, mysterious scoundrels, cute witches, high school delinquents, talking crows, and skilled martial artists on your way to becoming a Kiai master.\n\nUSE YOUR WORDS\nCreate custom attacks by combining words up to the limit of your spirit level. The more spirit you have, the more slots you have to place words into and the more powerful and complex actions you can take.\n\nAll words have cool downs and opponents might be weak or strong against specific attacks or specific elements. You won\u2019t know which until you engage them in battle so you need to be prepared to improvise.\n\nCOLLECT THEM ALL\nWith over 200 words to collect across the game there is a near infinite number of possible unique attacks to make. As you expand Ringo\u2019s vocabulary you\u2019ll need to carefully select which words you take into battle, building strategies around your mix of categories, blend of offensive and defensive words, giving yourself options to manage your opponents weaknesses and strengths, consider optimizing the juggling of cool downs and, of course, which attacks sound the coolest.\n\nThe result is an accessible, immediately fun but deep combat system.\n\nSTEP UP WITH PEP UPS\nThe core ethos of the Kiai martial art is to fight with honor. Defeating an opponent with honor can turn the most heated of rivals into the fastest of friends! Befriend your rivals to earn their words of encouragement in the form of useful Pep Ups which can be equipped to give you special bonuses in combat.\n\nTHE STARS CALL\nTravel the universe on a rollercoaster adventure as you seek the pieces of the Wanderstar map, Ringo\u2019s lost brother and the answers to Wolfe\u2019s mysterious past.\n\nUNLIKELY ALLIES\nAlong the way you\u2019ll build a found family of colorful characters, each with their own thing going on. They might not all get along at first, but that\u2019s nothing a thrilling space adventure can\u2019t fix! And even with the trail gone cold, take heart, for these wandering stars are bound to find each other...\n\nAN ANIME YOU CAN PLAY\nInspired by anime the developers grew up watching, Wander Stars plays out across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d, each one taking between 60-90 minutes to complete. Each episode features a map to explore with procedurally generated battles, special events and other secrets to find along with the main story events.\n\nPlay an episode at a time, or binge the whole thing in one go! You can even replay episodes to find all the side adventures, NPCs, and party member banter you might have missed! Try new paths as you explore ever-changing maps with randomized special events, lurking rivals, and tantalizing treasures.

Are you a sucker for a world of monsters and magic?\n\nDo you like wholesale violence peppered with coarse language, and served with a side of pixelated booty?\n\nThen buckle up, you legend. We're going for a ride...\n\nGet ready to travel far and wide, taking on creatures of all shapes and sizes in classic turn-based fashion, while discovering the secrets and adventures that Allegoria has in store.\n\nHarvest the body parts of your adversaries for financial gain and personal satisfaction, level up to strike down even greater foes, and arm yourself with more weapons and equipment than any sane person could be reasonably expected to carry on their person at any given time.\n\nThere are more than 144 unique enemies to face on your adventures through Allegoria, from ferocious Canadian geese and majestic tortoises to your bog-standard fantasy staples like dragons, unicorns, and the ever-ubiquitous slimes! There are plenty of beasts and beyond to encounter, each with unique item drops that can be sold in shops for the gold you'll need to purchase weapons and equipment to aid you on your journey.\n\nHave you ever played a game that has one weapon you just can't put down, or an armor set that makes you indestructible? It's a great feeling, isn't it?\n\nToo bad that's not the case here.\n\nIn Allegoria, if you want to get stronger, you'll need to master as much equipment as you can if you want to increase your stats, and if you think you need new attacks or magic spells to bring with you into battle, you'd better replace that old gear with something new, and fast. With more than 80 skills to learn and almost 150 pieces of equipment to collect, you'll want to try them all to find the right move set for you!\n\nThere's no shortage of personality in Allegoria, and everyone seems to have something to say. Most of it's just fluff to fill in empty spaces and make the world seem more lifelike, but every once in a while, someone actually has something useful to say.\n\nThey may be a little rough around the edges, but the people of Allegoria are always willing to guide you on your journey, and they might even have a quest or two for you to earn gold and other helpful items.\n\nThere's a story in there somewhere... it's just buried under layers of madness and debauchery.\n\nIf you think grinding for experience and mastering weapons is tedious, try to unravel this Gordian knot of a narrative.\n\nDoes it have a deeper meaning? Absolutely!\n\nDoes it matter? No! It's a video game! Just enjoy it and stop worrying about what kind of subliminal messaging the developer is trying to inject into your subconscious...\n\nIf you're a fan of retro handheld RPGs with a 2-bit pixel art aesthetic but are tired of the same played-out, stereotypical, fantasy adventure, then be sure to pick up The Edge of Allegoria today for a refreshing take on the genre that influenced a generation!\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/330e94ee874c586f958de84c18497fe947c89fdf1cd06fc2be88974a6a1e1a7b.jpg","id":"01007B902305C000","intro":"Turn-based RPG, inspired by classic titles from the golden age of handheld gaming.

But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset. \n\nExperienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!\nTeams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!\n\nWAYS TO PLAY\nPlay solo or online. Be tethered together in local or online Co-Op. Race your friends in local Splitscreen. Enjoy the chaos of Fling to the Finish in a way that fits you.\n\nCOURSES!\nEvery course in Fling to the Finish has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next. \n\nATTACKS!\nOpponents battle back with hails of plungers, sinking weights, and evil lasers if they fall behind.

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era.
