On a quest to save your people, you have found the mythical creature called \u201cLueur,\u201d a fiery companion who will light your way. But what kind of ruler will you be?\n\nEvery choice matters as you explore different strategies and play styles in Dawnfolk.\n\nMinigames add a unique challenge to supporting your people. The better you are at the minigames, the more resources you get and the more likely your community will weather the darkness. \n\nNot everyone has time to invest hundreds of hours into learning how to play a grand strategy game. You can dive right in and start building your settlement immediately, going from a handful of tents to a big city in less than an hour. \n\nDecades ago, titanic obsidian monoliths rained down from the sky. A raging tempest of unfathomable darkness gathered around them, slowly crawling across the world and consuming all in its path. You are the ruler of this land, once mighty and resolute, now broken and wounded. But not defeated! You intend to reclaim the realm and bring back light to the world.\n\nAfter years of wandering, your story begins as you finally find the Lueur, a mythical creature able to radiate a powerful enough brightness to dissipate darkness. It is time to explore the shadows and rebuild your realm.\n\nYour choices determine the fate of your realm and its inhabitants.\n\nWill you turn a blind eye to impending disasters, or will you face them head-on?

Players become the robot Ropoko and must escape from a maze-like laboratory with the help of \"Doctor.\" Learn words through conversations and use the vocabulary you've acquired to solve various puzzles!\n\nThe Nintendo Switch version is an enhanced adaptation of the original MZ-700 version, improving playability with features like word selection, auto-mapping, hint functions, and gamepad support, making it easy to enjoy in any play environment.\n\n\n- Gameplay\nThough interactive fiction games are generally considered high difficulty, we've designed ROPOKO to be accessible even for those unfamiliar with the genre.\n\nMovement is handled entirely with the Joy-Con\u2122, providing smooth navigation similar to action games or RPGs.\n\nIn traditional text adventure games, players input commands as keywords to direct the character's actions. In ROPOKO, only one noun is needed to issue commands. You don't need to input verbs or objects as in conventional games; just type a noun while in contact with the target to ask questions or use items.\n\nExamples: \"ropoko,\" \"laboratory,\" \"door,\" \"wire.\"\nOnly words encountered in previous conversations can be used, so increasing your vocabulary through repeated dialogue is key to progression. Commands can be entered either by typing directly on the keyboard or selecting words using a cursor.\n\nThe game includes various puzzles, mini-games, and complex dungeons to keep players entertained. After completing the game, you can aim for the shortest completion time or the highest vocabulary score.\n\n\n- About the MZ-700\nThe MZ-700 is an 8-bit computer released by SHARP in 1982. The original version was on this machine, which lacked graphic capabilities, so the game screen is entirely represented with character graphics (pseudo-graphics made from text). Large characters, which occupy two-thirds of the screen, move smoothly thanks to machine language programming. Although the sound source can only produce single-tone beeps, ROPOKO offers 12 background music tracks and 20 types of sound effects.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1cad2ba4cf6bfac32bb281a6a385f8a8a9bb780d59397bddfe8f014d7d635eb8.jpg","id":"010094A020256000","intro":"What made the MZ-700, which couldn't even display graphics, a national computer? \nOnly the MZ-700 knows the answer...","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en"],"name":"ROPOKO for Nintendo Switch","nsuId":70010000100229,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Waku Waku Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251009,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6ee2610a2e61a9364471755b32f14e6cd5942e0fa56d5d5cfbb4b39bf594c36b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3d9860b6ffc4885d3232168e55fe8e60eeeb1329519acf42af3f4479892f3ab1.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4de978f1b5d826bd68d1295d4217649f053b2cddf1a26ab5e3977ed3295b45ce.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9d02a8ffac66d6af5a618e08bf2c92f2b940cfe1b9bce8ca824f8121c5c8a7f4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b45fd54d19c0d199bbb436a82d70870aa22dd5a4ee1f58f09da935c8921a89a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/56df240a5bd9483a05d8e1a3e3ebf96cca24f4aa2c520f7aa07096dce75d1dcf.jpg"],"size":279969792,"version":null},"70010000101134":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2e1c877ec872ea2b3be90e913f611047f6d1b4d55e4a8d71bb762172bf19fe33.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","Puzzle"],"description":"With art inspired by classic animated movies and a story from Chris Darril (Remothered series), Bye Sweet Carole is a narrative-horror game that has you embark on a dark whimsicle tale full of mystery, intrigue and secrets.\n\nSet in the early 1900s, in an age where the women's suffrage movement has begun to shake the British nation, young Lana Benton must follow the last known trail of Carole Simmons to find her best friend and uncover the dark truth behind the Bunny Hall orphanage. \n\nAs Lana dives further into the enigma, she will find herself poised between the real world and the fantastic kingdom of Corolla that, under the cruel influence of the terrifying Mr.Kyn, the insensitive owl Velenia, and the ravenous colonies of tar rabbits, is perishing.

These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsettling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair.\n\nYou'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n\nSINK INTO THE SPIRAL\n\nDon\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere. There are dark mysteries waiting for you as Low and Alone follow their mirror path across the Spiral. As each new location will become more dangerous and disturbing than the last, traumatic flashes from the past will begin to emerge. Will Low and Alone finally escape from this unending nightmare?

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era.

So much so that I completely forgot I'd even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.\nNow that things have finally settled down, I\u2014Yuri Mito\u2014am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.\n\nJust as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.\n\nThis is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.\nThe Tayutama Fan Disc brings you the lovey-dovey days of a couple in love!\n\n\nMain Characters\n\u25cf Mashiro Mito, VA: Risa Matsuda\nUpon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call \"\"intense\"\", and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she's not exactly human...\nMashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that's just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.\n\n\u25cf Ameri Kawai, VA: Kaori Hanano\nThe childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She's a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro. \nShe can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she's a bit on the timid side...\n\n\u25cf Mifuyu Kisaragi, VA: Rina Misaki\nShe is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls' Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She's well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn't mean she isn't without her flaws.\nShe's rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man...\n\n\u25cf Yumina Takanashi, VA: Yu Aoto\nYumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise. Unfortunately, Mari Mito, the family matron, passes away long before the start of our story, and Yumina is ultimately adopted to the Takanashi family out of concern of a lack of mother figure.\nShe's one of those people who immediately fails at a task whenever someone is watching out of nervousness. But she doesn't mind working hard, and she's actually rather good at handling the household chores. She tends to get lost in her own imagination. \n\n\u25cf Nue, VA: Mika\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nShe transformed into a human-like form over 500 years ago, but due to some unknown incident, lost her memory and has remained that way ever since.\nAfter Mifuyu offered to become her guardian, she quickly grew attached and now brings a cheerful, innocent energy that puts everyone at ease.\n\n\u25cf Ouryu, VA: Taiyo Sorano\nOne of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.\nOnce thought to see humans as nothing more than prey, it turns out the truth is quite the opposite\u2014he simply envisioned a different kind of coexistence from Mashiro.\nThough he usually hides in the pond in the Kawai family\u2019s garden, he often takes human form to walk among people.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0934a67c1194fd5500aa7e387f2d23aad5f551c7de86168d1756dcfc1bdeb745.jpg","id":"0100A13022F30000","intro":"This is a story that picks up after the main events... or maybe one that could\u2019ve happened somewhere along the way.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh","zh"],"name":"Tayutama:It's happy days","nsuId":70010000095542,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Frontier Works","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Temas sexuales","Uso de alcohol"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251023,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/220f03a24f8768494a018765234f63ef2e74c1541fff80140ea7f9a9fa396299.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a710dd613e65e684d484c1a6ec883fbc89694a36f3fbeb01b433710395756425.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/72cb8f79cd774dfec75cf5dc0d6db16f1b0f678b21322ed0c1bc64375c06e139.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/63fc0f96b3db6ac51e2474385540ac9ce63c99ab78d99ebb405c52c8cf11477a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c56d96620dfe6ae3a3ebc479c1a092d1692030233b49036f4fb549d6fcd40857.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f9fca505631eb6d8f95bc5f9da34c96553b167c3559f3090df5c1a221ad921ef.jpg"],"size":4083154944,"version":null},"70010000098108":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/26f05300a3c43c196dc6ec85ea4c10c27373ed2a50998cb78d0142566add8fc0.jpg","category":["Sports","Adventure","Party","Multiplayer"],"description":"Welcome to Sports Camp, the ultimate party game packed with over 35 unique and unexpected\nactivities.

This world is populated by powerful yet mostly useless wizards and strange creatures. On his journey, Simon must solve a series of tricky puzzles, operate alchemical devices, and learn powerful spells. And yes, he also has to taste a few disgusting stews! \n\nPuzzles, Magic, and Simon\u2019s Humor \n\nWhether you're visiting the Magical World for the first time or returning once again \u2013 Simon is back, along with his unique sense of humor and a completely new graphic style. Simon the Sorcerer Origins brings the charm of the original saga back in a completely hand-drawn graphic style, blending classic gameplay mechanics with a fresh, new world of magic. \n\nYour Adventure, Your Puzzles \n\nSolve loads of tricky puzzles, test your wits, and face a variety of absurd situations and quirky characters.

Now, descendant of Erdrick, it is your destiny to defeat this new evil and rescue the world from its plight!\n\nThe Setting:\nThis tale takes place in the land of Alefgard, a realm given shape by a goddess known as Rubiss. The hero travels the land hoping to slay the mighty Dragonlord once and for all. Along the way he meets plenty of charming characters and faces numerous fearsome foes.\n\nDRAGON QUEST II Story:\nMany years have passed since Alefgard was saved at the hero's hand, earning him the same title as his storied forebear. The descendants of this Erdrick and his scions founded three kingdoms that thrived in peacetime. Yet, darkness stirs once more and a sudden invasion of malicious monsters plunges the world into shadow again. All that stands between the forces of evil and their wicked ambitions is a band of young princes and princesses of Erdrick's lineage. The time has come for them to venture forth and honor their ancestor's legacy!\n\nThe Setting:\nExplore a world filled with locales visited by the legendary hero as well as a host of new towns, castles, caves, and dungeons.\nAs the story progresses, you'll obtain a ship, which will allow you to traverse the seas and rivers, and broaden your horizons ever further.\n\nThe Party:\nThe Prince of Midenhall, the game's protagonist, is joined on his quest by his cousins the Prince of Cannock, the Princess of Moonbrooke and, entirely new to this version of the game, the Princess of Cannock.
