Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet.

This made every playthrough (attempt) feel different and unique.\n\nIn 2024 the highly challenging underwater shoot \u2018em up from the game development legends at Rainbow Arts is finally returning.\nININ and Ziggurat have collaborated to bring you a faithful remake completely rebuilt from the ground up and greatly improved.\n\nRedrawn:\nThe impressive sprite work of yesteryear has not only been remade into even more impressive modern high-resolution sprites but also greatly expanded upon with particle and lighting effects. 8 varied stages, the enemies, the bosses, the ships, the projectiles\u2014everything shines in a brand-new light!\n\nRemixed:\nApart from the visual journey of each playthrough, you\u2019ll embark on a musical one as well: epic synth soundscapes that drive you forward by the magnificent Chris H\u00fclsbeck. In addition to him remastering his original works, we have created six entirely new tracks as well.\n\nRemembered:\nAnd it's not just Chris H\u00fclsbeck who has returned for this remake: Ogan Kandemiroglu, the brother and co-artist of Celal Kandemiroglu who created the original iconic key art of X-Out, took on that task for the remake as a tribute.\n\nRe-equipped:\nThe shop system is back and thoroughly improved as well: new preconfigured load-outs allow you to jump straight into the action, added item descriptions help new cadets configure and build their fleet, and we've FINALLY marked the available slots for your weaponry.\n\nReinforced:\nShould you still feel overwhelmed by X-Out\u2019s challenge, then maybe it\u2019s time for a co-captain.

So fight hard, fight well, but also\u2014fight with style!\n...And crack some crass quips at the pre-fight press conference too!\n\nAs for the in-ring action, weather thrilling exchanges amidst cheers from a capacity crowd, sinking a finisher at the right moment to nab the three-count!\n\nThe more popularity your team amasses, the more visitors will flock to your gym\u2014and the more merch you'll ultimately move. You can even erect an arcade, karaoke room, batting cage and much, much more for some welcome added revenue!\n\nLastly, any team worth its salt needs more than a few members. Should a particularly talented wrestler catch your eye, see if you can't bring him or her onboard! This will grant you access to a whole new world of 2v2 and 3v3 tag matches\u2014meaning more tussling territory for you to terrorize!\n\nWell? What are you waiting for? Mask up and get in the ring! This is the business of bash, brother!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/50b604905f340c6211b358fcab7928d843f487de53c9b21af40156fd852ae9b8.jpg","id":"0100278021018000","intro":"Pro Wrestling Team Management Sim, Face off with fearsome foes!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Pro Wrestler Story","nsuId":70010000088836,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Kairosoft","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Violencia de fantasia"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250220,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ffcc78abc0dcdb8a95214c8b368eb44a698fb1f8d405cf9c36b832f0d611b562.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/02eee55979d8169aafc9b407da4de627a174ab66fc7a4f06ff6c8ec02577ec30.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0fde307d685a11bf7743689772adb397d85901b2a458456b9ad39be6f0c6dbe3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b6f30fd3a6030e81887d933b2a841c3cb86211ae07c5819b70ba5ccf09d40106.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/308db9b866510bc9fcf6b1a0057ac8fb97c8f623acb2f52edbdf6cbe616f23be.jpg"],"size":104857600,"version":null},"70010000090724":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b65e52f09e4e901da749467fe0aa7024569605c8d9cc75f9046e12c4d976d7bb.jpg","category":["Platformer","Action","Puzzle"],"description":"Desvelado is the first Bed-Time-Vania game in history!

But before they find mankind's new home, they must locate the ultimate treasure in some ancient ruins to pay off... a planetary loan?! Their quest will take them to three different planets, the first planet is Impostar, a planet filled with aliens from all four corners of space. The second planet is Igni, a fiery planet with a harsh environment. The third planet is Froslara, a planet as frozen as its residents are rich.\nAnd on every planet, new encounters and incidents await!\n \nOver 100 aliens!

Via this phenomenon, Earth saw an influx of aliens and, before anybody realized, all the planet\u2019s major cities were occupied by these migratory extra-terrestrials.\nConcerned with this situation, Dr Victor Franklin, a leading researcher on longevity, decides to search for a second Earth. In order to that humanity may thrive once again thrive once their new home was found, he creates two androids, Thunder and Kyla, and sends them in on their quest aboard the Omega 6 spacecraft.\n\nAnd thus began Thunder and Kyla's long and extraordinary adventures.\nCreators\n\nStory & Art by Takaya Imamura\nTakaya Imamura joined Nintendo in 1989 and worked on the art direction for series like Star Fox\u2122, F-Zero\u2122 and The Legend of Zelda\u2122.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
