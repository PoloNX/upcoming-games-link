Each move demands strategy and patience, since a single mistake can cost all your progress.\nWith 30 levels spread across two unique settings, the game begins in the fiery Entrance of Hell, full of bubbling lava, and advances to the imposing Temple of Hell, a dark yet refined place with marble columns and flaming pyres.\nRelax, rethink your moves, and challenge your logic in an adventure that blends brain-teasing puzzles, infernal atmosphere, and plenty of charm in every stage.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b9684b54f946fe4bd8192773adb5839803a9eb1d195d1ae5a46ef9313b35766.jpg","id":"0100DF70252FE000","intro":"The Best Guardian Goat of the Underworld","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","pt"],"name":"Goat Out Of Hell","nsuId":70010000105445,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Afil Games","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251031,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cb50f88b95636b6f044ae5ed8a48e3909a6df6bb453a2e2827b4081575b681a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c2e5f2a813594fa141612af8c42013aa530d3bf1af6bdec9ebc1a96ad45e419.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4407f8a30008f5624ac74b440bd8e329e4fbca94a4be885a12e9d9b9679da6bc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6ee3f762481c83bbbf5f3e561fb0628328f753620f473b3aef776886c05f52e0.jpg"],"size":58720256,"version":null},"70010000106600":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/32ea510e7b54549afe60f15d4916b471a668bb7629e8d4666f53ada326aaf64f.jpg","category":["Adventure","Platformer"],"description":"People used to say that parrots aren't real pirates, that they only belong perched on a captain\u2019s shoulder.\n\nBut one particularly ambitious parrot is in search of his own treasures and adventures to become a true pirate, a Beaked Buccaneer!\n\nExplore four different pirate-themed worlds with alternative paths, and defeat the infamous Captain Smelly and his nefarious crew.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Metroidvania gameplay\n* Colorful 8-bit style graphics\n* Four different pirate-themed worlds\n* Equipment upgrades and leveling\n* Battle pirates and discover treasure","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7ae6302b4a3e73edbe1718574cb3e7c917ff4440ebaa4bf2de5b04ccb3340da6.jpg","id":"010052702573C000","intro":"Become a parrot pirate legend!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","pt"],"name":"Beaked Buccaneer","nsuId":70010000106600,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Ratalaika Games","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Violencia de fantasia","Bajo contenido de sangre"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251031,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bcb5be2c5c90e0f428ba9272b1b345ae56366b1de5c79a2f0631f73d91d6ee2a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/68c600147306091a1c5cba904402e125dc6ca75d4d89188bc626d087bd271486.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/dbbe1238b850c348ce80d37fc4b20029db1e9d4143cfdaa70e836fd12f6ecb6b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ca52835db7e86c3320934157a61b44a4b8825303eb290daafe190477aeced852.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7def43876427c889e227313fdf4e37dfa3a811b4ac397c0ff075759e43db0ca4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d0bf08468554120f99ac3aab93389b5b955db5466ee2817d5a47499ea428510b.jpg"],"size":63963136,"version":null},"70010000107303":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0c8db2659877a6a22ddcbb875cb0fce3c5d187e410c3cb6e7e4e71e3856b5ec5.jpg","category":["Simulation"],"description":"The gates are locked, the line is long, and the air is thick with tension\u2014and possibly zombie breath.

It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side.\n\nOn the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance\u2014as she speaks with the devil himself.\n\nIndika\u2019s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov.\n\nENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES\n\nThe subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika\u2019s journey and she\u2019ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey.\n\nOdd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren\u2019t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms.

1980s.\n\nLong ago, in the Tohoku region of Japan, people were tormented by malevolent spirits, Y\u014dkais.\nHowever, through people's unity and after a long battle, they managed to trap the Supreme Leader deep in the earth and built a shrine on top of it.\nTime passed...\nOne day, the Supreme Leader who was imprisoned underground resurfaces, putting the Tohoku region in danger once again. \nAs the master of the shrine, you must cleanse each area and free the Y\u014dkais captured by the Supreme Leader.\n\n\uff1cGameplay\uff1e\nDraw lines to enclose areas while avoiding collisions with enemies and boss attacks in each stage. \nThe area enclosed by the line will be unsealed. \nContinue unsealing areas to release the characters trapped in the background.\n\n<Clear Conditions>\nTo clear the stage, enclose the character's silhouette and meet the stage-specific quota (%). \nEven if your health reaches \"0\", you will still clear the stage if the quota is achieved.\nAfter clearing a stage, you will receive a lovely \"reward\" from the freed Y\u014dkais.\n\n<Stage Variations>\nThere are 46 different types. \nSo every time you play, the stage size may be different.\n\n<Game Over>\nThe game will end if time runs out or if you run out of health.\n\n\uff1cUnrivaled Barrier\uff1e\nThis barrier can block enemy attacks. \nIt can be activated as long as you hold down the

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\n\nNow 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!\n\nThe original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian and Spanish.
