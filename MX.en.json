Take your time with each passenger, there is no room for mistakes!\n\nWork at the Port never ends. A continuous stream of trucks flows through the state of art fixed deep X-Ray head. Time is of the essence so make sure to compare the bill of lading document details like container identifiers, supplier names, and the list of declared goods with the items you see in the container. You\u2019ll be surprised by what some shippers have in store for you!\n\nAn ever-increasing number of packets are shipped to the island every year. Sniffer dogs to the rescue. You have to inspect all suspicious packages - those singled out by the sniffer dogs, coming from outside of the EU, or with a particularly low declaration value.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if this feels too overwhelming, Reggie and European-wide intelligence will help you along the way.",

    "description": "When Chico the chubby-cheeked chipmunk stumbles into a portal in the forest, he\u2019s transported to a magical world! Here he finds giant walnuts galore, but getting them home won\u2019t be easy! Solve puzzles and challenges across a variety of unique levels, gather a horde of giant walnuts, and help Chico get back to his forest!\n\nWith unique dual-mode gameplay, you\u2019ll have to really use your nut to crack these worlds. Alone, Chico can jump over obstacles and push wall switches. If he has a walnut, he can roll it over spikes, bounce it off of walls and bumpers, and more. Find a way to get the walnut through to the end of the level with you! Each world introduces unique new mechanics that will test your brain and your skills.\n\nChico and the Magic Orchards is made to evoke 8-bit handheld games. Catchy chiptune music, simple controls, and pixel-grid filters let you feel like you're playing a \"lost classic\"! Play the game in fixed 4-color mode, automatic palette mode with a special 4-color palette for each area, or the new Full Color mode!\n\nEven after the end credits roll, that's not the end of Chico's adventure! Continue your game after beating it to start playing the new post-game campaign A Hive Divided! Rescue trapped bees across two new giant levels, and defeat the Queen Bee. Power up your walnut with fire, water, and honey for a whole new spin on solving puzzles and exploring areas!",

    "description": "ARK: Genesis Part 2 completes the eons-spanning story of ARK: Survival Evolved! Everything that your tribe has built, tamed, and fought for has led to this final challenge. With your faithful artificial companion HLN-A by your side, you\u2019ve emerged from the Genesis simulation to find yourself aboard a gigantic starship being overtaken by a familiar threat from the distant past.\n\nIn Genesis Part 2, you\u2019ll explore a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills. Wielding an array of powerful new tames, items, weapons, and structures, you\u2019ll journey from idyllic fields through twilit phantasmagoric realms, all the way into a hellish heart of darkness. Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you\u2019ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time!\n\nNEW STORY-ORIENTED MISSIONS\nA holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of engaging new story-oriented missions at varying difficulty levels, as you build strength to confront Rockwell in a final battle for the ages. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover Explorer Notes and environmental cues along the way to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga.\n\nEXPANSIVE WORLDS TO CONQUER\nIn ARK: Genesis 2, you\u2019ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor. Your skills, your tames, your weapons and your builds -- everything that you\u2019ve accomplished is put to the test here, as the future of humanity hangs in the balance!",

Ultimate Edition gives players access to the entire chaos-filled Tools Up! package, including base game, all DLCs, and updates.\n\nTime To Get Renovating\n\nGrab your tools and hard hats; we have some home makeovers to do. Tools Up! is a chaotic local co-op game that puts your renovation and teamwork skills to the test. Work your way up a sprawling apartment complex as you renovate more and more intricate homes to meet the exact (yet often bizarre) requirements of the local tenants.\n\nLocal Couch Co-Op for Up to 4 People\n\nPlay with up to 4 friends to add to the efficiency or outright chaos of your home renovation team. NOTE: This game supports local couch co-op only; there is no online multiplayer mode. The game can be played in single-player, but it is recommended to play with at least one other person.\n\nPlenty to Do Here\n\nThis isn\u2019t a simple job, so we brought in some professionals - well, kinda. Every level requires you to tackle a lot of jobs and not make a mess of it. Sweeping up after the demolition crews, painting walls, laying tiles, plastering wallpaper, collecting deliveries, and cleaning up after yourself just to start.\n\nCompetitive Home Makeovers - New PvP Mode\n\nA brand new player vs. player mode that pits your team of renovators against each other! Race to complete the most tasks possible but also interfere with the other teams every step of the way. Various gameplay modifiers will keep everyone on their toes and can be played in various combinations for up to 4 players, e.g., 1v1, 2v2, 1v2v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1, etc.\n\nTouch Up The Outdoors - All DLC Included\n\nThe Tools Up! Ultimate Edition includes all 45 levels of the Garden Party DLC. Dive into levels set in the seasons of spring, summer, and autumn as your outdoor renovation crew rebuilds patios, plants trees, spruces up lawns, and deals with a few pesky raccoons or moles.\n\nEach pack of season-themed levels comes with new mechanics, settings, and a mighty boss fight at the end!\n",

    "description": "Control a Pong ball aching to break free of its life stuck between two paddles. Explore a dangerous, minimalist world, armed with simple two button controls: tap a button to change direction diagonally by 45 degrees, and hold down a button to unleash a cathartic dash forward. That\u2019s all you need to solve environmental puzzles and labyrinthine levels. Around each corner is a new challenge that will test your two-button and problem-solving skills. A variety of difficult enemies and bosses help you mark your time as you navigate through 30 levels spread across four worlds.\n\nqomp2 effectively captures the essence of the original 1972 Pong and its spiritual successor, the 2021 experimental indie title qomp.\n\nKey Features:\n\nCerebral Puzzling: The simple, two button controls belie complex and compelling gameplay. Use your reflexes and think ahead to avoid hazards, flip switches, and bounce your way through 30 tricky levels. Hidden collectibles push you to explore every inch of the minimalist maps.\n\nA Surprise around Every Corner: qomp2 constantly delights as new features, mechanics, enemies, traps and hazards are introduced as you progress deeper into the game. Don\u2019t get complacent: As soon as you\u2019ve mastered one aspect of gameplay, another is ready to challenge you.\n\nBosses: Four challenging bosses block your path at the end of each world. You will need to use all your newfound skills to master their attacks and defenses. Don\u2019t worry. Death isn\u2019t the end in an arcade-inspired world.  Quick respawn makes sure you\u2019re back in the action in seconds.\n\nA Serene Soundscape: A soundtrack of ambient jams gets you in the groove, and helps you keep your cool, as you work your way through the minimalist maze.\n\nAn Emotional Journey: An enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly through simple effects and gameplay.",

    "description": "A grieving boy begins to read a Bantu tale written by his late father. Adventure into the beautiful and treacherous lands of Kenzera as Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness. With your cosmic powers and untried courage, you advance into unknown mythological lands. Once bursting with life, Kenzera is now rife with lost ancestral spirits. As Zau advances toward his goal, three mighty beings lie in wait, fearsome in their strength yet somehow strangely familiar. Will you embrace the dance of the shaman?\n\nEmbark on a poignant single-player story shaped by actor Abubakar Salim\u2019s own experience with grief,  discovering how love gives us the courage to press on after devastating loss. Wield powers from the Sun and the Moon to defeat restless spirits in rhythmic combat and become a worthy Nganga: a spiritual healer. Discover a rich universe with untold lore of chaos & order and journey through mystical 2.5D realms awash with colour and depth, emboldened by multi-award-winning composer Nainita Desai's enchanting original score.\n\nCrafted by Surgent Studios, the entertainment studio founded by actor Abubakar Salim (Assassin's Creed: Origins, Raised by Wolves) and published by EA Originals, Tales of Kenzera\u2122: ZAU takes you on a thrilling emotional journey inspired by the rich myths of Bantu cultures.\n",
