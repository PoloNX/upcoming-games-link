One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era. This feature allows players to learn about Yoshiwara, even aspects that many Japanese people are unfamiliar with. Additionally, the game supports English and Simplified Chinese, enabling players from different language regions to explore and learn about Japan\u2019s Edo period.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/18b8e1558f9af283c908914584dac0fdc624ad2c8db8b26b2fd9361e8a4d9b8d.jpg","id":"0100D14021E4A000","intro":"A Time loop mystery set in Japan\u2019s Edo period!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh"],"name":"GHOST TRAVELER: Adventures in Edo","nsuId":70010000097776,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"SUCCESS","rating":18,"ratingContent":["Viol\u00eancia Extrema","Conte\u00fado Sexual","Drogas L\u00edcitas"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251016,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de6f4dad0480e5705c8f3e93d1ba0fe377afb688f91259cbc8a3fa63e068ca9e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/25e88f73150091b2b86dc3c6d9164075a149de6e1780865ce5e049a5ad95db1a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2d4203bd9d7fba4f2582a2457337e34059c0c19ae063e84038ab74c944024c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a890c1da6f7356a724f82461bc79ee808bcea193a035dafd4c2a2e3e34762f10.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a21b5fd243cd30eda0f2a9c3604965876bed8bcf2ea5906eee0733db58a1d66c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1ae2395cbd2852e932e3116e0d0e49e26c2392054dba66863566a1fba2567344.jpg"],"size":2091909120,"version":null},"70010000099365":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/870d2482d0369ab35e5615e585b8908c0365f1901d0ac39be73c5e922ad4b4ec.jpg","category":["RPG","Action"],"description":"Lumiose City\u2014a home for people and Pok\u00e9mon alike.
