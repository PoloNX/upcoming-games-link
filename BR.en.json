Some just require a few upgrades here and there. Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you!\nDid we mention wildfires?\n\nTrackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way.\n\nThe game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists.\n\nGATHER RESOURCES\nThere aren't many resources in the desert, so you\u2019ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way.\n\nUNLOCK BLUEPRINTS\nYou\u2019ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, it\u2019s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely.\n\nBUILD\nWith enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key.\n\nDEFEND\nAttacks are frequent. You\u2019ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, you\u2019ll have to be more creative with how you use them.\n\nKEEP THE TRAIN GOING\nFeed your train with fuel, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything. Try to automate things to keep moving as the game gets harder and harder with time and distance.\n\nFEATURES\n- High replayability value\n- Many items to gather and craft\n- Multiple game modes\n- Mini quests to complete\n- Random deterministic map generator","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8a14f6a207f6d8acbb157c58be888701450234566f216dad3053b97e3870ab59.jpg","id":"0100AD801E6F8000","intro":"Embark on a thrilling journey through an unforgiving desert.

Join forces with your friends on a challenging adventure.\nControls: If you could handle a NES\u2122 controller, you\u2019re overqualified. Arrow keys move, everything else happens like magic (the old-fashioned kind).\n\nKey Features:\n\n16-Player Mayhem: Ikki Unite can be played by up to 16 players simultaneously in online cooperation. Create your squad joining Gonbe, the forty-something vigilante, Magoichi, the trigger-happy legend and many others!\n\n4 Classes: Play as one of the four archetypes: Explorers, Attackers, Enhancers and Healers! \n\nEpic Action: So much action, you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re playing what was once dubbed the worst NES\u2122 game ever.\n\nRoguelite Madness: A different adventure every time you play, chose between a wide set of randomized items and bonuses! Because predictability is so 1985. [ And you don\u2019t even have to put another coin in ;)]\n\n\nSurvival Tips for the Hopelessly Outnumbered:\n\nThe Buddy System: Stick with your team. Or at least try to find them before the final boss does.\nThere's strength in unity: Even bigger enemies can be taken down when the squad is united and working together.\nResurrection: Fallen comrades can be brought back to life, don\u2019t leave them behind!\n\n\nSUNSOFT: The Dawn of a New Era\n\nSUNSOFT is back, dusting off the NES\u2122 cartridges and leaping into the modern era with Ikki Unite. It\u2019s a love letter to the fans who stuck by us, an opportunity to make amends with those we have tortured, and an invitation to new players to join in the fun. Because if we can\u2019t laugh at ourselves, who can we laugh at?","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/73561162ca360af17e5dab177e13c7ad72ce6b2d832db3fd42bf638da7218b0f.jpg","id":"0100D3001CEBE000","intro":"The game you loved to hate is back !

Every time you visit a world, the story will evolve, allowing the protagonist and player alike to discover new possibilities.\nAs the story unfolds in this way it becomes a tale all of your own, not only affecting the path you walk but also the multiple potential endings that await each protagonist. \n \nBattles where a Single Choice Can Change Everything:\nSaGa Emerald Beyond further refines the highly strategic Timeline Battles the SaGa franchise has been long renowned for. With series mainstays such as the skill to spontaneously acquire abilities through the Glimmer system, tactical ally placement known as Formations, and United Attacks that enable individual skills to connect together to form devastating chain attacks, it offers the best iteration of SaGa's turn-based combat to date. \n \nThe new combat system adds more drama than ever before, allowing you to support party members, interrupt enemy actions, and use United Attacks by strategically manipulating the order of ally actions.\n \nThe characters that join you, the weapons you wield, your party formation, and your tactics in battle - everything is up to you!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2b558dc6c1733239b7015b60a874b95dba40addcd3c612edee5ffe1c30083043.jpg","id":"01008BE01E1C2000","intro":"FORGE YOUR OWN TALE","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"SaGa Emerald Beyond","nsuId":70010000077231,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"SQUARE ENIX","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Viol\u00eancia","Conte\u00fado Sexual","Linguagem Impr\u00f3pria"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240425,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/469d08590e1b1b7a27e8c35eb67ee872999eb87d86c2a613f220e63cd077d332.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5ab5ccb53796f4f05646911f330cb9d2b1dea7640868b3b8a094a804072b744e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3c975d0c0b74698cc017d432cfde2f1c543ee0d23a4a9adbb91963e367c602e4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/83a207289c9a9a3c84507aea69162a4356e736384bcdce8cbbe124f3e5de0be0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2cecaf3f3783317597b5da801ba4149cbd05ba0c1531c09233e1c933c7b9f6e5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/84129335963af7173c8cf2a8196c9b123335c96cecde03f279a11dbfb7ec273a.jpg"],"size":3770679296,"version":null},"70010000077957":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c0d81c41c1af90ebbe2261a45f5fe66455b50427fa3a0b9ed05bd256f0ddf4a0.jpg","category":["Puzzle","Adventure","Board Game","Other"],"description":"Come and visit the famous Big Apple for a brand new cat-spotting adventure!\n\nRelax and look around the city, and with enough patience, find over 700 feline friends!\n\nThe city only gets more vibrant the more cats you find! :)\n\nFeatures:\n- 700+ furballs to pet;\n- A huge cityscape to colour in;\n- A few extra places... full of the tiniest of cats :)","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2a1083d7dcff1647877dfb372be90c3f859de2ebc1fe82e157c858628b68e773.jpg","id":"010089401E4CA000","intro":"Meow meow!
