Experiment with it to unlock its full potential.\nThis is a game with true star power!\n\nA Legendary Soundtrack\nThe composer David Wise hardly needs any introduction. In his work on the Gimmick! 2 soundtrack, he has both written completely new melodies and remade old classics. The soundtrack was creatively directed by Pelle Cahndlerby and recorded live in Sweden together with Joel Bille.\n\nBlast from the past\nThe original Gimmick! game was released for the Famicom\u2122 in 1992. It was localized and released in the West - but only in Scandinavia. This, combined with the fact that the game's physics and gameplay mechanics were far ahead of its time, made the game both fabled and beloved. With Gimmick! 2, however, there is no longer any doubt: this is a game that the whole world should have the chance to experience.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8c5c0288cc33c6e2677b31411bf109a9deaed9bcc354e58e72eb0b81afc83f62.jpg","id":"0100DC301F3F8000","intro":"Yumetaro is back!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Gimmick! 2","nsuId":70010000081724,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Clear River Games","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240905,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07b8274557de40f5b290279ddc7e0059c32380c482604182c1c860173bb7a62c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b97bb9ca4ff84c5b824689d0c34e659f67cf650ef2c7626025270e14b2fb3b9a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9d9af0bcb81970ceafffc946a8d8462f55b399227798671290758ccf1f29d527.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/815d1578ee0cc3b967e0be25cdbb56134c8f0fe031910bd9e331c54eeba920ef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b97bb9ca4ff84c5b824689d0c34e659f67cf650ef2c7626025270e14b2fb3b9a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/56901e0b04c207819352194e281a83eace2855774c717a01c7a33eb591d5ce7f.jpg"],"size":1627389952,"version":null},"70010000083904":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d551b2dee1b267f36000ce3ae52b20001cb26dc0fa0609a89defd7896e38ab66.jpg","category":["Sports","Training"],"description":"Partner up with Hatsune Miku, and duck, jab, and punch your way to fitness in the classic Fitness Boxing Mode, or in the brand new \"Miku Exercise\" mode featuring original songs from your favorite Piapro Characters!

Take control of Hito, Third Knight of the Empire, to investigate a missing royal and a rebellious faction called the Sons of Washington. Beware the descending Fog and lead the islanders in fending off the rebels and their Eldritch allies!\n\nGameplay\n\nExplore corpse-filled streets and dank cave systems or cleanse secret underground tunnels of the rituals aiming to grow the Fog\u2019s influence. As you search for a way to stop the ongoing destruction, you're sure to stumble upon some of the deepest, darkest secrets of the island.\n\nChoose from an arsenal of devastating top-of-the-line firearms: hand-cannons, triple-barrel shotguns, as well as prototype weaponry from the great Nikola himself.\n\nBreak just about anything, kick barrels of oil and set them on fire, or just straight up give the boot to your enemies and watch them trigger traps.

As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects.

It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher.
