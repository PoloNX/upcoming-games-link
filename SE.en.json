The player takes the role of a vagrus - a caravan leader who strives to survive in a strange and perilous dark fantasy world by leading a traveling company on all kinds of ventures.\n\nA Dark Realm\n\nA vast realm is yours to explore, filled with unique locations, strange factions, and a colorful cast of characters. In order to punish the Empire for its sins, the Elder Gods unleashed their power a thousand years ago that resulted in the devastation of the realms. The continent is now a wasteland, riddled with arcane anomalies, swarming with twisted monsters, and haunted by roaming undead even after long centuries of rebuilding.\n\nBranching Narrative\n\nA large selection of stories make up the game\u2019s narrative in the form of events, encounters, and quests. The choices you make in these often affect your companions as well as the world around you. Pick your background from trader, mercenary, or explorer; work for factions, pursue rumors and trading opportunities; acquire wealth, gain fame, and discover hidden knowledge.\n\nTurn-based Combat\n\nEngage in turn-based, tactical combat that involves your companions and a large variety of enemies, both humanoid and monstrous. Use a wide range of character skills as well as your own leadership-related abilities to succeed. Positioning and support skills are of paramount importance in these challenging engagements.\n\nResource Management\n\nJourneys have to be planned and prepared for carefully, lest they end in disaster. Manage your supplies, morale, and your crew\u2019s vigor effectively to survive. Haul cargo and valuables across the wasteland or take it from others. Your crew of workers, fighters, scouts, and slaves have to be supervised closely to optimize their effectiveness.\n\nUnique Companions\n\nA wide variety of companions can work for you in versatile caravan roles, such as scoutmaster, guard captain, treasure hunter, or beast handler. Each companion comes with unique combat skills, background stories, and personal quest lines that can upgrade them further when you complete them.\n\nPowerful Factions\n\nAlly yourself with mighty factions that shape the Riven Realms with their influence on commerce, brutal wars, and their constant intrigue. From prosperous Trading Houses to criminal syndicates and religious organizations, these groups offer powerful rewards and boons to those loyal to their cause. But take heed - befriending a faction will more than likely antagonize some of the others.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24797501ac970bee2d981a2bf98d0dc78741d7ced38b28e73bc461b5bf61d1ab.jpg","id":"01007E30210DE000","intro":"Embark on a perilous journey across a realm forsaken by the gods and devastated by an arcane cataclysm.

It is a realm torn by war in more than one way. The Empire rallies its immense legions here, sending them north toward the Green Continent to lay waste to its lush lands while the elite Chimera Legion remains behind to oversee this arid staging ground. Deep in the desert, however, lurks a different threat \u2013 that of the Ahari. Birthed by the native Bandul and tempered by their unwillingness to yield in the face of Imperial oppression, the Ahari seek to win back their sacred oases and holy sites, fighting an impossible campaign of terror. Amidst it all are the Handjari, sworn allies of the Empire and stewards of the greatest city in all the Bronze Desert \u2013 Kabur, the Jewel of the North.\n\nThe stage is set, the stakes are high. Who will you, a mere vagrus, align yourself with? The mysterious Ahari and their Sun God or the cruel Chimera Legion and their ruthlessly pragmatic leader, the Legate? Your decisions will shape the fate of the region writ large, paving the way for a new, uncertain future throughout the Realms.\n\nAnd yet, dear vagabond, how will you reach such a land, cut off from the outside by raging winds and deadly geography? Surely, you will need to traverse the Realms in a new, peculiar way rarely ever used by other vagri.\n\nSunfire and Moonshadow offers a new, vast region to explore complete with a swathe of new settlements, new enemies to conquer, new stories to be a part of, a large cast of characters, and new quests to complete through which the vagrus may make their mark on Xeryn. With all this, as well as the introduction of a central conflict involving three new core factions \u2013 the Ahari, the Chimera Legion, and the Handjari \u2013 the expansion features content roughly one-third the size of the core game.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Vagrus - The Riven Realms Sunfire and Moonshadow","nsuId":70050000052918,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"LOST PILGRIMS STUDIOS","rating":16,"ratingContent":["Drugs","Strong Language","Discriminatory Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250331,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7010d01795e2f2821f593e74cf384a3bd66dd3d1d841dbaa0ebee0f5519000c7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/689ba77f4f1a70ace44d2f6ce4902c9d027188b9dd8a1b9e275db7af9b9f3937.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b236f7b86ec4db9079cd8543df93b5b3b4a334055306a6313d1f0d68469e0b49.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/183f674b60a3de88dfbbf4e5b873284e4d1d7ba0e840116f56f081f94623932e.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70050000052948":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/fbf41057c15308292ed7576506ffdd177985ab7c2a35b257767df62b41a386a9.jpg","category":null,"description":"Two savants from largely disparate backgrounds: one born a slave, the other into Imperial nobility.

Built with a couch co-op experience in mind, up to four players adventure through the magical and dangerous Sunderlands.\n*The free mobile app is required to play the game.\n\nEach player picks one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture out into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat.  During combat, there is no set player turn order, so your strategy can adapt at a moment's notice to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to co-operatively find the best path to success. \n\nBetween missions, players return to Arden and help improve their home village. Unlock and upgrade different local vendors, build relationships with other Sunderfolk to earn rewards, and outfit characters with new Skills, Weapons, Trinkets, and more.\n\nAs heroes of Arden, protect the town and its Brightshard from the corruption of shadowstone and defeat threats from the surrounding Sunderlands. \n\nCouch Co-Op First\nThe best adventures are meant to be shared. Up to four players can play together in this new tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. \n\nStep into a New World \nScan a QR code on the display, download the free Sunderfolk phone app*, and transform your phone or tablet into a controller, hand of cards, rule book, inventory, and more. All friends and family can learn to play quickly, since all they need will be in-hand. \n\nSix Unique Heroes \nTraditional RPG classes have been reimagined in Sunderfolk. Take up the mantle of an Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger or Rogue \u2013 each with their own playstyle. Tailor your character\u2019s strengths with Skill Cards. Power up with Trinkets and Weapons to craft your character\u2019s build  quest-to-quest. \n\nTactical Combat Inspired by the Tabletop\nEach player takes their turn one at a time by choosing one of their Skill Cards to determine their character's actions. Enemies lurk around every corner, each with their own abilities and strategies, and they will challenge your party to change its approach from one encounter to the next.\n\nRebuild the Village of Arden \nThe village of Arden grew around the remnant of a magical substance known as brightstone, but unknown forces from lands outside have started to threaten this community's very existence. Between quests, return to Arden village to upgrade vendors, acquire new items and equipment, and befriend townsfolk for additional rewards. \n\nFour Players, One Game\nShare the experience of Sunderfolk with friends at no extra cost. Our rather unique mobile device as a controller mechanic lets one gamer share the adventure with three friends at no additional cost. A host can even stream a session and have friends join remotely.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/62d82838826430e3cfb75b25404422ef5beeb64173f1bcff0402e8c04158b8e3.jpg","id":"010074E01F616000","intro":"Rediscover Game Night","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","pt","es","fr","de","it","zh"],"name":"Sunderfolk","nsuId":70010000082103,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Dreamhaven","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Moderate Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250423,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8dd5eb911e562f27c8e4b9a3e8cb14e0a7c5e1ffb6a33c76885370fce803dda5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/18ac56bd3b349ea356134cf8ef476223b659d1a247f9dc5749ad3ea0446f8257.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f8d4d848f7030d3ae18a34a6bd95c78109238a9044dd3404633f964b29486643.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/59787cd81c2d9530e3b04c3820d153707e691d09e48d4fad5640fa70ad8565ca.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/42a75ae0afdfd905f47c5e5d6adcf92a7ac399c7a8898129c0db207b7364bcf5.jpg"],"size":9750708224,"version":null},"70010000091339":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aa80fd5e92bc5750c2894757427afe0f0cbe71eac144c93fdafbed13f3b432bc.jpg","category":["Puzzle"],"description":"Put your brain to the test across dozens of unique challenges in Hegzis, a chill hex-grid puzzle game presented in colourful 2D style!

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","en","fr","de","pt"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086483,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000046104":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df5e52844738f32f17e1654480187020ced34f51e902672540af805ea857719d.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7026","ids":["0100FBD013AB7026"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 15: Oil & Dirt","nsuId":70050000046104,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000046108":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8e22033788d5f9c44aeb0820db8814c5ae1712b4c7898dc2f3eee21b26b4ead.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7027","ids":["0100FBD013AB7027"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 16: Expansion 4","nsuId":70050000046108,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000047044":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a4a391ee3bad55c7bbb29cc319ef1c77238064e684678e75629483006e47ec50.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your Expeditions: A MudRunner Game experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"01002C101C1AB006","ids":["01002C101C1AB006"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game - Season 3","nsuId":70050000047044,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000047045":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/342f8f5fdd65df2e551d102c2674da2de779ee296a4013ff199b2f3a65ffe2f7.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your Expeditions: A MudRunner Game experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"01002C101C1AB007","ids":["01002C101C1AB007"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game - Season 4","nsuId":70050000047045,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000050278":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b59db540c24f7b35a50c4cba4a777098a21edb38f5b88c8ac3732c7ed85f232.jpg","category":null,"description":"DLC 2 Worlds Beyond 2 contains:\n\u2022 2 Additional Characters\n\u2022 New additional scenario\n\u2022 Costumes for additional characters\n\u2022 Weapon for additional characters\n\u2022 Stamp for Additional characters\n\u2022 Additional player card background\n\u2022 Additional weapons\n\n*This product is also included in bundles.
