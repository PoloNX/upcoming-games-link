In each level, you\u2019ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don\u2019t jump while the eye\u2019s watching, or you\u2019ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you\u2019ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter\u2019s kaleidoscopic visualizer.\n\nDon\u2019t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.\n\nAt its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made. A cacophony of colors dazzle your eyes as the music gradually builds up based on your progress. If you want to take a break from the arcade action, jump into the ungame, where you can channel your inner Jeff Minter and play around with all the sights and sounds from the game.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 55 levels with a variety of challenges to conquer in each\n- Unique tube-shooter bonus stages between each level\n- Llamasoft's unique brand of mind melting visuals\n- Procedural music that builds as you rack up a high score\n- Earn your bragging rights in the online leaderboards","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c0dde56763322bf0b593c9fd7312e66df7b64adf166ab6b6e5fcc4711031fc5b.jpg","id":"010086901F822000","intro":"Jeff Minter is back with another unique take on a 1980s Atari arcade game: I, Robot.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es","fr","de","it"],"name":"I, Robot","nsuId":70010000082765,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Atari","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250417,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a59ac3a782e9cda7ae33d1ab927c61dab720ac630aee66573cf985551bb4b45f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e8f74cf87b4e59b8b920b26c3a4a14d73a16f20fa4f2033301f71d63007033b4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8108455b5b392e35434130f29b1fda548a3dc203090eaf483ce63cf9b4f80dbb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d315becddf4ad73c2dea33bb92b58da9e18c25eddab1cc389f93f647edf7e89a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/520fbccad8912fb9159c22a7849c48563c7abbcc551443d39547dacbd0f00c7a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5a91051eac5d63cbf78ae3531cb995e2c4507123ddf103a7d91744130880b6a7.jpg"],"size":208666624,"version":null},"70010000083294":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/87f1d8479f8bc83632d85751a150aef186f80c09e29aaaa01704ad769c151862.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","RPG"],"description":"Humankind abandoned Earth as it entered another ice age.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","en","fr","de","pt"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086483,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000046104":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df5e52844738f32f17e1654480187020ced34f51e902672540af805ea857719d.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7026","ids":["0100FBD013AB7026"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 15: Oil & Dirt","nsuId":70050000046104,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000046108":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8e22033788d5f9c44aeb0820db8814c5ae1712b4c7898dc2f3eee21b26b4ead.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7027","ids":["0100FBD013AB7027"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 16: Expansion 4","nsuId":70050000046108,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000047044":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a4a391ee3bad55c7bbb29cc319ef1c77238064e684678e75629483006e47ec50.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your Expeditions: A MudRunner Game experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"01002C101C1AB006","ids":["01002C101C1AB006"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game - Season 3","nsuId":70050000047044,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000047045":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/342f8f5fdd65df2e551d102c2674da2de779ee296a4013ff199b2f3a65ffe2f7.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your Expeditions: A MudRunner Game experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"01002C101C1AB007","ids":["01002C101C1AB007"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game - Season 4","nsuId":70050000047045,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000050278":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b59db540c24f7b35a50c4cba4a777098a21edb38f5b88c8ac3732c7ed85f232.jpg","category":null,"description":"DLC 2 Worlds Beyond 2 contains:\n\u2022 2 Additional Characters\n\u2022 New additional scenario\n\u2022 Costumes for additional characters\n\u2022 Weapon for additional characters\n\u2022 Stamp for Additional characters\n\u2022 Additional player card background\n\u2022 Additional weapons\n\n*This product is also included in bundles.
