The animal world is in chaos. Naturally, the solution is tanks.\n\nIn BattleTanks - Animal Wars, you\u2019ll roll into battle as a Racoon, Bear, Wolf or even Panda (yes, really) and blast your way through five bizarre worlds filled with explosions, bad driving, and questionable military decisions.\n\nCustomize your ride with different weapons and weird tank parts. \n\n- 80+ story missions featuring combat, defense, side-scrolling chaos, and puzzles\n- Ridiculous mech-bosses that really, really don\u2019t like you\n- Local co-op for up to 4 players - because friendship means firing wildly in every direction\n\nSwitch between top-down mayhem and first-person fury, and take down the mole menace once and for all. Or at least\u2026 blow them up repeatedly.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/395fd0609ba1997d8a5702f5645532dba979fa0f492ed7fb258c9d41187746c7.jpg","id":"0100D1C0249A8000","intro":"Save the animal kingdom from mole-fueled doom.\nFace giant mech-bosses, collect weapons and build you tank.\nUnleash tank fury - solo or with friends!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it","ru","ko"],"name":"BattleTanks - Animal Wars","nsuId":70010000104757,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Kasur Games","rating":7,"ratingContent":["Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260114,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/64386ceca10051b64296e5e21accfd7395bc1625a98f3ef1390913e3dde61ff4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0235928294ac278f352ffc84b50ec02ecb4de5b272011281939b19e01ca42f3e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/03a86bba97a3d18782bfaed7bb4c3d9b69eebc5b1d24be4881f91ebd93636f7a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2930f5d6b8bd62d9f217bfdbc2b70e924b0977c75a790f6a76a3b59d30416f04.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/368b456d0553f6c34ec766708877d55c94e245b031babf4e86f1e01fe06a79e2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df648ff1cc53e94275ea46dad7c4870500da50c1ad73a5f9ea98a7c312e747d2.jpg"],"size":266338304,"version":null},"70010000110441":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/43fe4c85db89d8881dc38e3942fb94742b55a33d2996956a159f45552397c5f8.jpg","category":["Simulation","Multiplayer"],"description":"A carefree new life is just beyond the horizon!
