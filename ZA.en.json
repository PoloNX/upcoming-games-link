Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end \u2013 but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\n\nBUILD AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF CITIES\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game.

The Frogs join the effort to push back the storm, bringing their skill with stone masonry and love for water with them. Meanwhile, a changing of the tides has unlocked new potential in the distance \u2013 the Coastal Groves have finally become accessible after countless cycles spent under the deluge. Though they remain isolated and hard to reach, the ancient, submerged settlements of the area hold great treasures waiting to be uncovered. Meanwhile, unique opportunities present themselves in the once-thriving forests left barren by the march of industry \u2013 the Ashen Thicket is littered with broken trunks and remnants of a past age, awaiting a masterful Viceroy to restore its forgotten glory.\n\nAgainst the Storm - Keepers of the Stone includes:\n- Welcome the dignified Frogs to your settlements and take advantage of their proficiency with stone masonry, the comfort they take in rainwater, and their ability to increase the rate at which new citizens join your settlements.\n- Explore the new Coastal Grove biome where settlements start along the water, far from the easy reach of royal envoys and the benefits they provide. Rely instead on the Strider Port building \u2013 unique to the Coastal Grove biome, it allows you to launch expeditions seeking treasures buried in the surrounding waters. The Strider Port offers a fresh way to seek out new building designs with each expedition simply requiring a supply of food for the Water Strider and its rider alike \u2013 the more you\u2019re willing to invest in supplies, the better your potential finds might be.\n- Brave the new Ashen Thicket biome, ravaged by industrial exploitation and the Blightstorm alike. The barren lands here are home to the rare Thunderblight Shards \u2013 lightning-infused crystals that can be mined at great cost, crucial for forging Cornerstones using the Ashen Thicket\u2019s unique Cornerstone Forge building. With only a limited number of opportunities to produce your own Cornerstones, you must strategically choose which conditions and rewards go hand-in-hand, with the option to take on penalties in the hopes of bolstering their benefit.\n- New rewards are added to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City to benefit the new Frog species alongside 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 1 new Epic Cornerstone, 3 new Rare perks, and 5 new Uncommon perks.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Frogs as a playable species, you must reach level 9.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"010062F01F2CD001","ids":["010062F01F2CD001"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Against the Storm - Keepers of the Stone","nsuId":70050000056101,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Bad Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f8f9d0fafe7fdf346fb6e94becd111ceb04d69cce21ca266ad3b7eaacb8edcca.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/20f1324c8c52a4033714815173337b2dedbe3548da6bd34cd9e7fc355c591d18.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e530107176554b65628cdfe449d36986f3c67e3c452698bd011c5025d0757335.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6fb7dde72ff848922c69f6c80a868f80be58be49af7ee564fa741c8424d50af0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/eab4adeaf08e09fb0d5b7ecc4b3ab4658c4ead633770bbc6a5c3ccb763bd399c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6729fe301aa4502772875bfa6620b9037da52e0e8e5f16b1fd0c55b8411d93ee.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000056189":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a2e0ca99a83822d414d86e1f4433d73afc2946b226a48457d86c3e60e0b8a794.jpg","category":null,"description":"This DLC unlocks a brand new world for hexceed: Flavum! \nPuzzle your way through 145 brand-new levels!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Unlocks a new world for hexceed: Flavum brings 145 new puzzles and includes all mechanics from the previous DLC.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Flavum","nsuId":70050000056189,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"ToastieLabs","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7b53b18da29033fb288a86e03224ba2c04c900150b071b89a514456d33ded0c9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8f6c21729e48026153c9f0b05a032b99ba5dbb037a851a59c207b6c45a6979b8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ba45b1606fac22889cd25aeebaa06044e1f745fd4441b4be1312745539d1763f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/01004865980160bbd135e4cbf5dc1f57547da7762f26b870fd689898d95993af.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d7336384e8a2fc585c4bb71c89dd5e9ceabdaf8e3ae012f2424323f60267cf1b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/50f67cc8179bb567155c1090b5d581038461b879d7a48d6872e11e33699a4271.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000058449":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/367d541def0931621cc277036993f878b39fe3e6518ba1ddf28c13569c3f6e48.jpg","category":null,"description":"Extend your collection and design rooms with twenty new items.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Create your dream room and make it truly yours","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Cottagecore","nsuId":70050000058449,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"REDDEER.GAMES","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9cac34ff4e56769302c01bb635a5e354b31f513123ad763b490691a180149ff9.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70050000058450":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7522ed63fa85e2676faa88fdf0897bff60c06b4289af58e00cae8ce13e1f77aa.jpg","category":null,"description":"Extend your collection and design rooms with twenty new items.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Create your dream room and make it truly yours","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Mediterranean","nsuId":70050000058450,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"REDDEER.GAMES","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/448888ae6cf7f53e9c0eb1e5c150e8a39d029e0ad58af1e82929e9d301650df6.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70010000064037":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1e40f3d48edb3fe9414a076ddf1cc891a637df8e6978739fe185a33f43d34274.jpg","category":["Simulation"],"description":"The latest and completely new title in the Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop series is coming to Nintendo Switch\u2122!\n\nTamagotchi Plaza is set in Tamahiko Town on Tamagotchi Planet.\n\nTreat cavities at the Dentist.

These beasts, known as Kemono, embody the very essence of nature in all its beauty and ferocity. The key to surviving the fight lies in joining forces with comrades and wielding Karakuri technology.\n\n\u2022 Develop your hunting grounds using Karakuri technology.\nWeaving the threads of Karakuri enables you to instantly create basic items like crates and gliders. You can even combine these items to develop Karakuri like beast-piercing blades, protective shields, and traps to stop movement in real time, all of which can aid you in your battle against the Kemono. There are also some Karakuri that will remain on the field, giving you the freedom to place them in strategic locations and create your own ideal hunting grounds.\n\n\u2022 Customize your play experience with diverse combat styles.\nThe game features a wide range of equipment. From general weapons like the nodachi and bow, to unconventional ones like the karakuri katana and bladed wagasa, each weapon has unique characteristics. By utilizing materials gathered from the hunts to craft new equipment, hunters can persist in their pursuit of beasts. This ongoing cycle enables hunters to grow even stronger and challenge themselves in combat against numerous fearsome Kemono.\n\n\u2022 The story and world:\nNo one remembers why the Kemono began their rampage through a once-prosperous Azuma. Fueled by desperation, they wield the power of primal nature at its most destructive. For a while, it seemed that none could stand against their overwhelming might. But hope arrives in the form of a formidable hunter armed with deadly weapons and ancient technology called Karakuri that could turn the tide of battle.\n\nNote: In addition to the supported languages listed in the store, the game is also available in Spanish (Latin America) and Polish.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/764ad47267f2c664ba2959b2dd85bac4d906bc75d64da0f8556c427155aea47e.jpg","id":"0400E23021102000","intro":"Hunt giant beasts using a variety of Karakuri tech, now with up to 3 teammates!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"WILD HEARTS S","nsuId":70010000097420,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"KOEI TECMO EUROPE","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Moderate Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250725,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/66f757b1761af6dbf809d67fd3ed5e94b07799423a417af26f65b4bd5c46b2dc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0c1008526aec3d1fca4ca850300e212259ddeea76dfa9786b6493a481c9985ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3a8acbfae40d021ceaa3469380ef26e15176fa0698694e5b374584321ada9a59.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bf239fa0929770fc4a1c7316752bd27d38a132c8ae9071a1288bbc3636a80c63.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6f20d34018843c717bb4f493e2896562a418f3505e06e84509a1866eedb32af9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c319bbf900cb2f523f47ca10175ff41e496dce8df1f63068cf088ed134632642.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70010000097822":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5edaec1db6e640daa3889c94f684179006398c6dae66af1d54ef561fcd280041.jpg","category":["Adventure","Puzzle"],"description":"Iris the internet idol has been abducted by aliens?!\nFinding herself on board a mysterious UFO and tasked with completing a bizarre escape game, Iris knows there's one person who she can always count on for help: Kaname Date, Psyncer! \nAs Date, conduct investigations, solve escape game puzzles, and Psync into the dreams of potential suspects to help Iris escape and unravel the mystery behind The Third Eye Game!\n\n\u30fb Investigation: Use the special functions in Date's left eye to gather information that will lead to Iris's whereabouts!

Across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d of anime-inspired adventure, Ringo and Wolfe will have to work together to find answers, make up for past mistakes, and travel across the universe in search of their goal. And who knows, maybe they\u2019ll learn how to get along at some point!\n\nTrained in the ways of Kiai, a magical form of martial art and also the universe\u2019s most exciting form of televised entertainment, Ringo can combine words to create customized attacks in intense turn-based battles. Defeat or befriend a cast of fearsome space pirates, mysterious scoundrels, cute witches, high school delinquents, talking crows, and skilled martial artists on your way to becoming a Kiai master.\n\nUSE YOUR WORDS\nCreate custom attacks by combining words up to the limit of your spirit level. The more spirit you have, the more slots you have to place words into and the more powerful and complex actions you can take.\n\nAll words have cool downs and opponents might be weak or strong against specific attacks or specific elements. You won\u2019t know which until you engage them in battle so you need to be prepared to improvise.\n\nCOLLECT THEM ALL\nWith over 200 words to collect across the game there is a near infinite number of possible unique attacks to make. As you expand Ringo\u2019s vocabulary you\u2019ll need to carefully select which words you take into battle, building strategies around your mix of categories, blend of offensive and defensive words, giving yourself options to manage your opponents weaknesses and strengths, consider optimizing the juggling of cool downs and, of course, which attacks sound the coolest.\n\nThe result is an accessible, immediately fun but deep combat system.\n\nSTEP UP WITH PEP UPS\nThe core ethos of the Kiai martial art is to fight with honor. Defeating an opponent with honor can turn the most heated of rivals into the fastest of friends! Befriend your rivals to earn their words of encouragement in the form of useful Pep Ups which can be equipped to give you special bonuses in combat.\n\nTHE STARS CALL\nTravel the universe on a rollercoaster adventure as you seek the pieces of the Wanderstar map, Ringo\u2019s lost brother and the answers to Wolfe\u2019s mysterious past.\n\nUNLIKELY ALLIES\nAlong the way you\u2019ll build a found family of colorful characters, each with their own thing going on. They might not all get along at first, but that\u2019s nothing a thrilling space adventure can\u2019t fix! And even with the trail gone cold, take heart, for these wandering stars are bound to find each other...\n\nAN ANIME YOU CAN PLAY\nInspired by anime the developers grew up watching, Wander Stars plays out across 10 \u201cepisodes\u201d, each one taking between 60-90 minutes to complete. Each episode features a map to explore with procedurally generated battles, special events and other secrets to find along with the main story events.\n\nPlay an episode at a time, or binge the whole thing in one go! You can even replay episodes to find all the side adventures, NPCs, and party member banter you might have missed! Try new paths as you explore ever-changing maps with randomized special events, lurking rivals, and tantalizing treasures. The experience is never quite the same!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f789a2365255e8e68c8fa0907c8fdcd147c854f4df7d595d0c4118dbb3283cf2.jpg","id":"010034801FCBE000","intro":"Unleash custom attacks by combining words in a Super!

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names.
