This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time, you can move things around, connect things, flip things, to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, others by touching, pushing, or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected to function. For example, for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be attached to a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nTo rid the levels of the monsters! The simplest way is to push the monster off the edge of a platform and make it fall off the screen. You could cut the rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pull a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.\n\nKey Features\n\u2022 Solve over 500 wacky puzzles form each game across 5 different worlds.\n\u2022 Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n\u2022 Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing line pegs.\n\u2022 Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7bb4cebe0f8d56c89b14b7ab5d0abf1d771fe21cc29e2c1e934f76b6d647a8cd.jpg","id":"010042601DBB4000","intro":"Contraptions is a physics-based puzzle game with a fun cartoony look.

And all-new playable character Neera won\u2019t be left out in the cold, as she can use her powerful Frost Arts to punish foes.

After saving the world, zoom straight into the action in Classic mode or challenge your fiercest foes in the new Boss Rush mode.\n\n\u25c6Heroines to the Rescue\nFoe-turned-friend Neera joins the bombastic cast of all-female protagonists, each with their own unique abilities and perspective on a story reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon adventure.\n\n\u25c6The Brave and the Bold\nStage too hard? Too easy?

With help from your robot assistant, you will appraise, value, buy and sell a vast array of items. But remember: there are no umbrellas allowed. AVAC will be watching\u2026\n\nNo Umbrellas Allowed is set in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia where greed is a crime and the emotions of the populace are suppressed by a drug called 'Fixer', which is administered via rainfall. \n\nThrough a series of strange events, you find yourself in the position of manager at a well known second-hand shop called Darcy's.\n\nBy learning the tools and tricks of the trade - and with some help from a loud-mouthed robot assistant - you must earn money, raise the shop's reputation, and pay off your debts, all while trying to avoid any unwanted attention from AVAC (Association for Victims of Avarice Crimes).\n\nKey Features:\n\nEVALUATE: Customers will bring you a wide variety of items they want to sell, from the mundane to the marvelous. Use tools to discover an item\u2019s true value: worthless junk or precious rarity?\n\nHAGGLE: Once you\u2019ve decided an item\u2019s value, you can negotiate a price for it. Try to strike a balance between keeping the customer happy and ensuring a deal is as profitable as possible for Darcy's.\n\nPROFIT: Procured items can be displayed for sale in the shop\u2019s showcase. The rule of Darcy\u2019s is buy low, sell high. But don\u2019t get too greedy. Ajik City is not the place for flagrant avarice.\n\nREPUTATION: Consistently offering good item appraisals, good recommendations, and good deals all positively raises the profile of Darcy\u2019s and brings more customers into the shop. Be good at your job.\n\nUMBRELLAS: Strictly prohibited in Ajik City due to their ability to protect against Fixerain. Any umbrellas submitted to Darcy\u2019s must be handed over to AVAC.
