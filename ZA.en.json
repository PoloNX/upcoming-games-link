This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time, you can move things around, connect things, flip things, to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, others by touching, pushing, or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected to function. For example, for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be attached to a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nTo rid the levels of the monsters! The simplest way is to push the monster off the edge of a platform and make it fall off the screen. You could cut the rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pull a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.\n\nKey Features\n\u2022 Solve over 500 wacky puzzles form each game across 5 different worlds.\n\u2022 Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n\u2022 Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing line pegs.\n\u2022 Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7bb4cebe0f8d56c89b14b7ab5d0abf1d771fe21cc29e2c1e934f76b6d647a8cd.jpg","id":"010042601DBB4000","intro":"Contraptions is a physics-based puzzle game with a fun cartoony look.

Now, the world is protected from the traitors but vulnerable to external threats. Under the reliable protection of ancient mages, the shards are hidden in four parts of the world, and the knowledge about them is carefully guarded by keepers of knowledge.

And all-new playable character Neera won\u2019t be left out in the cold, as she can use her powerful Frost Arts to punish foes. Like its predecessor, this high-speed platforming adventure delivers exhilarating momentum-based action, but advances the formula with new gameplay systems and enhancements.\n\nWith 24 expertly designed stages, an ambitiously expanded Adventure mode, retro-but-refined 2D visuals, and the addition of the highly requested Boss Rush mode, Freedom Planet 2 is the indie darling grown up to become a true platforming power.\n\n\u25c6More Ways to Play\nExplore Avalice in Adventure mode, meeting over 100 NPCs along the way. After saving the world, zoom straight into the action in Classic mode or challenge your fiercest foes in the new Boss Rush mode.\n\n\u25c6Heroines to the Rescue\nFoe-turned-friend Neera joins the bombastic cast of all-female protagonists, each with their own unique abilities and perspective on a story reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon adventure.\n\n\u25c6The Brave and the Bold\nStage too hard? Too easy? Customize the difficulty with the new equippable item system that will let you change the rules of the game\u2014try summoning a helpful shield orb at the start, transform all item boxes into bombs, or any of the numerous other ways to dial the challenge up or down.\n\n\u25c6Fight Smarter, Live Longer\nThe new Guard button lets you parry enemy attacks\u2014sometimes with added benefits\u2014and the new Revival system lets you risk an extra life for a chance to make a comeback and eke out that tough victory.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/81f11a486825a5195e0db0c4aba8b5e48bd982ac580f4e7d52368cfdefd5553a.jpg","id":"01009A301B6D8000","intro":"The high-speed platforming of Freedom Planet returns with new features and more ways to play!

Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last.\n\nChoose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Take advantage of a sophisticated skill system to determine which strengths your climber should have.\n\nIn the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events.\n\nThree mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought.\n\nFace the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.\n\nKeyfeatures\n-no two climbs are alike\n-procedurally generated mountains\n-dynamic world with different weather effects\n-hundreds of events with ever-changing outcomes\n-strategic gameplay in path finding, stat and equipment management\n-3 characters with different abilities","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b82c8f32100cf396e41a1dd932e4357fc696dada854eb8f48da738941414e827.jpg","id":"010090C01AC4A000","intro":"Death always climbs with you","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","pt","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Insurmountable","nsuId":70010000065071,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment","rating":7,"ratingContent":["Fear","Implied Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240424,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/28325464f467c935fe9e153c3363963b9551446c7e75d52c47ecc7ea5c9f8e05.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e580a99940273724e10cf25695c4ffdf139bd8fd09b912dc577806600efb7cf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/573c4df95278f70c9234e1eca5ef54b94537ac08906904a42b9f2837d3311bb6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d52c2750e0642b1c5c8a94140bd13c7b2c0426419fa79febda7e49875e760fd4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cdec9d58ef397ed68c82e43ed6c5ed23e380f566a2c01ba58a429e5a6e0fb0bb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/172b5c69022ff04568df5d590b37d446f601e71c44e3a70b785883a6086849cb.jpg"],"size":744488960,"version":null},"70010000062740":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b50cbc681311d8813a23ee77f27fb4c7fe27edf7766735a6a12e07df39fc4e0.jpg","category":["Adventure","Platformer","Strategy","Other"],"description":"Search Of Light is a steampunk / dark fantasy setting adventure and the combination of resource management and narrative mechanics that we define as adventure management.\n\nThe player will get into the story from the perspective of The Foreigner, the enigmatic character who must ascend through the levels of the underground to reveal the mystery hidden on the surface.
