Spells boast evocative names (e.g., \"Seal, Recede,\" \"Flame, Be My Sword,\" \"Phantom Reinforcements Arise\"), well-received by many.\n\nWhile the previous game allowed escape from the Mugen Realm via the Heart of Illusion, how does one escape Elder Einh (the world of \u201cII\u201d)?

1980s.\n\nLong ago, in the Tohoku region of Japan, people were tormented by malevolent spirits, Y\u014dkais.\nHowever, through people's unity and after a long battle, they managed to trap the Supreme Leader deep in the earth and built a shrine on top of it.\nTime passed...\nOne day, the Supreme Leader who was imprisoned underground resurfaces, putting the Tohoku region in danger once again. \nAs the master of the shrine, you must cleanse each area and free the Y\u014dkais captured by the Supreme Leader.\n\n\uff1cGameplay\uff1e\nDraw lines to enclose areas while avoiding collisions with enemies and boss attacks in each stage. \nThe area enclosed by the line will be unsealed. \nContinue unsealing areas to release the characters trapped in the background.\n\n<Clear Conditions>\nTo clear the stage, enclose the character's silhouette and meet the stage-specific quota (%). \nEven if your health reaches \"0\", you will still clear the stage if the quota is achieved.\nAfter clearing a stage, you will receive a lovely \"reward\" from the freed Y\u014dkais.\n\n<Stage Variations>\nThere are 50 different types. \nSo every time you play, the stage size may be different.\n\n<Game Over>\nThe game will end if time runs out or if you run out of health.\n\n\uff1cUnrivaled Barrier\uff1e\nThis barrier can block enemy attacks. \nIt can be activated as long as you hold down the button, but it gradually depletes.\nOnce the remaining amount reaches \"0,\" you will no longer be able to block attacks.\n\n\uff1cTranscendence Orbs\uff1e\nCollect three Transcendence Orbs on the

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\n\nNow 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!\n\nThe original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian and Spanish.
