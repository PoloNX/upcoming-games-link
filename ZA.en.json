During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!\n\nBUILD ON A MOUNTAIN\nEach mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.\n\nDEAL WITH AVALANCHES\nOne of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can\u2019t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it\u2019s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!\n\nCRAFT A TRANSPORT NETWORK\nSo, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town\u2019s population, always look for opportunities to optimise your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.\n\nRAISE A SUMMIT TEMPLE\nIf you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavour you\u2019ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.\n\nFinal note: the game is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource management and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn\u2019t feature combat or any other military aspects.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/30ab956b4c53cbc233780eea0ae1880107d84a153663ca04b72b14f51190abe1.jpg","id":"010096602407A000","intro":"Build and expand your very own settlements in high mountains!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","pl"],"name":"Laysara: Summit Kingdom","nsuId":70010000099911,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Nejcraft","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20260227,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/658fa78dfea58ee123e13daf5f7ab280281086f9a8013818940f58ef70e0f720.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/60ade298b5253990b6a39ffa92f139b3a73b0d9c26890fc1c486ad51877b475b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1be1f90bfe9b4288b438988a0c2b7d9475d4855b81b9ea325a5d325e7e56fffb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ee411e69b837ff216e1fe01738cdc52e85d611f81c5dfc4253d55ea147354c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/da9bb603a1ffcbafb55e8db0408ea8eab65282a3a3bf5e1e269608cdab2ffdd2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3aae056bbe73bc70eaf94d69fe268a64ea58bbefcbfcfdc36da9cb48a891d2c3.jpg"],"size":1396703232,"version":null},"70010000105698":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cde46a7f4f803d340e3436461005cdad9bfad3a6f15293bef1efff777c6d8a97.jpg","category":["Adventure","RPG","Simulation","Action"],"description":"Cast your line.

Do you rescue your comrades or listen to the alien voice in your head and harvest them for upgrades?\n\nIf you can persevere and defeat the Star Spores, perhaps you can save everyone\u2026including yourself.\"\nGAME FEATURES\nMASTER THE CHAINSTAFF\nHurl it as a spear and slice aliens in half. Throw it to the ground as a shield to stop incoming attacks. Grapple and swing on just about anything. The transforming ChainStaff does all this and more, and all with one button, it\u2019s all up to you.\nYOU DIED\nPounded to mush, stabbed through the heart, sheared in two. Prepare to meet your doom in a myriad of disgusting ways. All deaths are avoidable, but some dangers may require special strategies.\nFEROCIOUS FOES\nThe creatures of Earth have been mutated by aliens: you\u2019ll come across dozens of unusual creatures, and once you get past those, you\u2019ll have to fight against screen-filling monstrosities.\nGROTESQUE UPGRADES\nStranded soldiers dot the landscape of ChainStaff. You must choose whether to rescue them or devour their organs; each option has unique benefits and will lead to different endings.\n10 WILD LEVELS\n\"Mist trails through rocky crags.\nWind blows over icy, moon-lit hills.\nWater streams down mossy cliffs.\nFully hand-drawn art immerses you in a living world inspired by album covers of the 70s and 80s.\"\nKILLER SOUNDTRACK\n\"Scorching riffs and peals of thunder. Pumping beats drive you ever forward.\nRock out to the classic metal soundtrack by the award-winning composer Deon van Heerden of Broforce and Warhammer 40k: Shootas Blood & Teef soundtrack fame. There\u2019s some lighter interludes with 70s synth, catchy melodies, and even some cowbell. Now it\u2019s back to the heavy tracks, where it\u2019s time to bang your head while smashing skulls.\n\nAll depictions of violence are 2 dimensional and heavily stylized. As part of your quest to cleanse Earth of the Star Spore menace, you'll use all the weapons at your disposal to defeat your foes, many of whom will die bloody deaths. Additionally, you may harvest resources from your fellow soldiers in order to increase the power of the alien keeping you alive, and this process is messy.
