When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!\nTeams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!\n\nWAYS TO PLAY\nPlay solo or online.

The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter.

One day, he is caught in a supernatural phenomenon in Shibuya and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a setting reminiscent of a Japanese historical drama. Eventually, Kotaro learns from a \"god\" that he has been transported back in time to the Edo period as a soul, and that he is now in Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo, the capital of 19th-century Japan.\n\n\u25c6 A Grotesque Mystery Adventure Set in Yoshiwara\nWithout knowing why he has arrived in this era or how to return to the modern world, Kotaro begins to wander around Yoshiwara in search of clues to unravel the \"mystery.\" Soon, he encounters the murder of an oiran (courtesan) and takes on the role of a \"detective\" to solve the case. However, he is drawn into a series of grotesque murders.\n\n\u25c6 A Time-Loop Narrative That Brings You Closer to the Truth\nThe mystery of the \"oiran murder,\" a central part of the story, cannot be solved in a single playthrough. The scenario is interwoven with multiple settings and foreshadowing, functioning alongside a time-loop system where the protagonist, as a ghost, can go back in time and possess others to replay events. This culminates in a dramatic twist at the end.\n\n\u25c6 Historical Mode Explaining Edo-Period Yoshiwara\nThe game is set in late Edo-period Yoshiwara and includes a mode that explains the lifestyles, customs, and terminology of the era. This feature allows players to learn about Yoshiwara, even aspects that many Japanese people are unfamiliar with. Additionally, the game supports English and Simplified Chinese, enabling players from different language regions to explore and learn about Japan\u2019s Edo period.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/18b8e1558f9af283c908914584dac0fdc624ad2c8db8b26b2fd9361e8a4d9b8d.jpg","id":"0100D14021E4A000","intro":"A Time loop mystery set in Japan\u2019s Edo period!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","zh"],"name":"GHOST TRAVELER: Adventures in Edo","nsuId":70010000097777,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"SUCCESS","rating":18,"ratingContent":["Extreme Violence","Strong Language","Discriminatory Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251016,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de6f4dad0480e5705c8f3e93d1ba0fe377afb688f91259cbc8a3fa63e068ca9e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/25e88f73150091b2b86dc3c6d9164075a149de6e1780865ce5e049a5ad95db1a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a21b5fd243cd30eda0f2a9c3604965876bed8bcf2ea5906eee0733db58a1d66c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2d4203bd9d7fba4f2582a2457337e34059c0c19ae063e84038ab74c944024c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a890c1da6f7356a724f82461bc79ee808bcea193a035dafd4c2a2e3e34762f10.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1ae2395cbd2852e932e3116e0d0e49e26c2392054dba66863566a1fba2567344.jpg"],"size":2091909120,"version":null},"70010000099366":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/770dc64c402c949be24c2cfe319cfd0eb4181ec18c7077122d8deaedbf6e23d5.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","RPG"],"description":"An urban redevelopment plan is underway in Lumiose City!

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","en","fr","de","pt"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086483,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000046104":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df5e52844738f32f17e1654480187020ced34f51e902672540af805ea857719d.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7026","ids":["0100FBD013AB7026"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 15: Oil & Dirt","nsuId":70050000046104,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000046108":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8e22033788d5f9c44aeb0820db8814c5ae1712b4c7898dc2f3eee21b26b4ead.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7027","ids":["0100FBD013AB7027"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 16: Expansion 4","nsuId":70050000046108,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000047044":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a4a391ee3bad55c7bbb29cc319ef1c77238064e684678e75629483006e47ec50.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your Expeditions: A MudRunner Game experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"01002C101C1AB006","ids":["01002C101C1AB006"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game - Season 3","nsuId":70050000047044,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000047045":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/342f8f5fdd65df2e551d102c2674da2de779ee296a4013ff199b2f3a65ffe2f7.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your Expeditions: A MudRunner Game experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"01002C101C1AB007","ids":["01002C101C1AB007"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game - Season 4","nsuId":70050000047045,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000050278":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b59db540c24f7b35a50c4cba4a777098a21edb38f5b88c8ac3732c7ed85f232.jpg","category":null,"description":"DLC 2 Worlds Beyond 2 contains:\n\u2022 2 Additional Characters\n\u2022 New additional scenario\n\u2022 Costumes for additional characters\n\u2022 Weapon for additional characters\n\u2022 Stamp for Additional characters\n\u2022 Additional player card background\n\u2022 Additional weapons\n\n*This product is also included in bundles.
