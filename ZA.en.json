This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time, you can move things around, connect things, flip things, to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, others by touching, pushing, or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected to function. For example, for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be attached to a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nTo rid the levels of the monsters! The simplest way is to push the monster off the edge of a platform and make it fall off the screen. You could cut the rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pull a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.\n\nKey Features\n\u2022 Solve over 500 wacky puzzles form each game across 5 different worlds.\n\u2022 Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n\u2022 Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing line pegs.\n\u2022 Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7bb4cebe0f8d56c89b14b7ab5d0abf1d771fe21cc29e2c1e934f76b6d647a8cd.jpg","id":"010042601DBB4000","intro":"Contraptions is a physics-based puzzle game with a fun cartoony look.

He desired to become a God and subjugate the entire world. At great cost, the precursors managed to reclaim the crystals of divine power. They shattered both crystals into numerous fragments. Now, the world is protected from the traitors but vulnerable to external threats. Under the reliable protection of ancient mages, the shards are hidden in four parts of the world, and the knowledge about them is carefully guarded by keepers of knowledge. Much time has passed since then... People have forgotten about the crystals of divine power. However, sensing the defenseless planet, universal evil began to infiltrate this world. Descendants of the keepers of knowledge, upon witnessing the turmoil, started gathering the crystal fragments. Time is running out.\n\nIn this game, you will become a keeper of knowledge, collecting shards of divine crystals. Look for the right way to crystals. Avoid dangerous obstacles.

Try to strike a balance between keeping the customer happy and ensuring a deal is as profitable as possible for Darcy's.\n\nPROFIT: Procured items can be displayed for sale in the shop\u2019s showcase. The rule of Darcy\u2019s is buy low, sell high. But don\u2019t get too greedy. Ajik City is not the place for flagrant avarice.\n\nREPUTATION: Consistently offering good item appraisals, good recommendations, and good deals all positively raises the profile of Darcy\u2019s and brings more customers into the shop. Be good at your job.\n\nUMBRELLAS: Strictly prohibited in Ajik City due to their ability to protect against Fixerain. Any umbrellas submitted to Darcy\u2019s must be handed over to AVAC. Failure to comply will be punished.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6c1bd8e6c954c2b5d31ae7128be8c7d62862961be27ff927620799073825f130.jpg","id":"010051B019EE6000","intro":"Looks like rain..","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","ko"],"name":"No Umbrellas Allowed","nsuId":70010000062222,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Digerati","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240405,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c0bacfeadcbb90b3ade672e27f7864281c6074b589b216634c01e93f3c4d7da2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a44ce29a539a792bf85e893371ffb724c06c55288215165520a39ae4b941beef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b75f4d1e4aaad853ae7da32c199d5267864280c02d28a774e086809a4c40a57f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4e6d8d887425eb970374baa9b5e5f1eb65ba4c6c006e2e1ca41cbea3dff10b2e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/15410d08312f25e5a558d3b66effbb790165c3623fde2b4086f7dac20ed5bf90.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/180099b6a9e8ba6f2466c645f80c04b5fd7e8facb258a30764aeba6bfa80cc5e.jpg"],"size":261095424,"version":null},"70010000072599":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de4bf37843c46b6d43db6aef453a0553666b8d1dd85b918831550bfabe3f172b.jpg","category":["Platformer","Adventure","Action","Other"],"description":"Slami, who did not go to university, goes to Intown to try to find his own special way in life.

Some just require a few upgrades here and there. Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you!\nDid we mention wildfires?\n\nTrackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way.\n\nThe game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists.\n\nGATHER RESOURCES\nThere aren't many resources in the desert, so you\u2019ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way.\n\nUNLOCK BLUEPRINTS\nYou\u2019ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, it\u2019s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely.\n\nBUILD\nWith enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key.\n\nDEFEND\nAttacks are frequent. You\u2019ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, you\u2019ll have to be more creative with how you use them.\n\nKEEP THE TRAIN GOING\nFeed your train with fuel, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything.

Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last.\n\nChoose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Take advantage of a sophisticated skill system to determine which strengths your climber should have.\n\nIn the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events.\n\nThree mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought.\n\nFace the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.\n\nKeyfeatures\n-no two climbs are alike\n-procedurally generated mountains\n-dynamic world with different weather effects\n-hundreds of events with ever-changing outcomes\n-strategic gameplay in path finding, stat and equipment management\n-3 characters with different abilities","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b82c8f32100cf396e41a1dd932e4357fc696dada854eb8f48da738941414e827.jpg","id":"010090C01AC4A000","intro":"Death always climbs with you","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","pt","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Insurmountable","nsuId":70010000065071,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment","rating":7,"ratingContent":["Fear","Implied Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240424,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/28325464f467c935fe9e153c3363963b9551446c7e75d52c47ecc7ea5c9f8e05.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e580a99940273724e10cf25695c4ffdf139bd8fd09b912dc577806600efb7cf.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/573c4df95278f70c9234e1eca5ef54b94537ac08906904a42b9f2837d3311bb6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d52c2750e0642b1c5c8a94140bd13c7b2c0426419fa79febda7e49875e760fd4.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cdec9d58ef397ed68c82e43ed6c5ed23e380f566a2c01ba58a429e5a6e0fb0bb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/172b5c69022ff04568df5d590b37d446f601e71c44e3a70b785883a6086849cb.jpg"],"size":744488960,"version":null},"70010000062740":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1b50cbc681311d8813a23ee77f27fb4c7fe27edf7766735a6a12e07df39fc4e0.jpg","category":["Adventure","Platformer","Strategy","Other"],"description":"Search Of Light is a steampunk / dark fantasy setting adventure and the combination of resource management and narrative mechanics that we define as adventure management.\n\nThe player will get into the story from the perspective of The Foreigner, the enigmatic character who must ascend through the levels of the underground to reveal the mystery hidden on the surface.
