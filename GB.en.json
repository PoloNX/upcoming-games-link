Join Contra Force and stride into a doomsday extravaganza in Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns. \n\nAssemble a squad of classic Characters and arm yourself with an explosive arsenal of arcade weaponry in this action packed expansion for Vampire Survivors. Blast through thousands of fearsome foes and bonkers bosses from throughout the lauded lineage of Contra games. Persist determinedly through prodigious stages inspired by iconic Konami series, but be prepared for a bullet-hell of a fight, because if\u00a0your trigger finger lacks stamina, Earth may lack a future. \n\nOperation Guns embraces the visceral simplicity of classic Contra, with build-focused Characters that encourage min-maxing and stat manipulation, a tonne of weapons (we're talking 22 including evolutions!), and a difficulty curve that combines quintessentially arcade-hard gameplay with the Vampire Survivors formula. \n\n11 Contra-Tough New Characters \nA squad of determined Contra Force Survivors deployed to become the bullet hell, including: \n\nBill Rizer - a big guy with a big gun, bent on vengeance against an alien menace. \nLoves: action movies, high-calibre rounds. Hates: Cryogenic coffins, space creatures. \nLance Bean - known for attacking aggressively, always having hair dye on hand, and having a brain almost as impressive as his muscles, Lance is partially responsible for creating Contra Force's strange new weapons. \nAriana - forced to defend her home amongst the jungles of Galuga from the vile traitors of Red Falcon, Ariana is an expert in evasive manoeuvres, turning her Movement Speed into extra Armour. \nLucia - is she a clone? A cyborg? A tabula-rasa terror tutored by Team Contra to be the perfect warrior? Her past is a mystery, but her deadliness on the battlefield is well known, as is her reputation for rebounding from any supposed defeat even stronger than ever. \nBrad Fang - the bad-butt product of twisted genetics and cutting edge cyber-tech, Brad Fang is half-man, half-wolf, half-robot, and 150% super soldier.  \nBrowny - designed to be an all-purpose battle bot, a string of strange bugs (or features) in Browny's programming have caused this diminutive droid to be obsessed with partying. Fortunately, this calamitous coding error does nothing to impede Browny's prodigious combat prowess. \nSheena Etranzi - a guerrilla combat genius especially skilled in jungle combat and all manner of experimental weaponry, Sheena is a true survivor and no stranger to prevailing against impossible odds. \nProbotector - a hyper advanced recon robot programmed to protect humans in inimical environments, this RD009 Probotector Model can convert any enhancements to its Armour into more Might for its many modular weapons. \n\n22 New Fully Automatic Weapons \nArm yourself with Contra Force's radical arsenal with almost-homing missiles, a bevy of high-tech blasters, and the ever faithful Spread Shot. Evolve these deadly contraptions into experimental Prototype weapons, and supplement every salvo with 3 new Pickups - you'll need every edge you can get to survive the challenges of Operation Guns. \n\nGaluga & Beyond \nRun and gun through multiple mayhem-filled biomes inspired by classic Contra levels. Explore Galuga Jungle, Neo City, and the treacherous Alien Zone in a hazardously horizontal main Stage bristling with iconic enemies and brutal bosses. Rev your jetbikes and take on a highway of horrors in a furiously fast-paced challenge stage. \n\nContra Tracks & Remixes \nIncludes classic Contra tracks and covers:\nBattle in the Jungle - VS version\nBloody Falls - VS version\nYoru no Nikusyokujyu - VS version\nThe Hard Corps - VS version\nGTR Attack!- VS version\nMilitary Fortress- VS version","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Grab your blaster, join Contra Force, and be the bullet hell in Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns","nsuId":70050000047743,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"poncle","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Moderate Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240509,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b2bd9feb6d6ee919b69118a363a54149c342df9a9001b4f6e30d5eb892a21136.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1213425ecd2008f5c9244b454aca90b711ea0ffac60ee9f987f9357b8e3ff4c5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ffb2d255ed0bdfe3c515d969ed08eafb3fc21ad838522b2ef711a4bf2e34b1f0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07ed868393f6c9d03870d7c0812be419b3a721cbd022a511caf210f9e7f93d29.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a51ef69ecdd7255582b586db3067804e221c51374af96f210a54860cf87bf071.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/96b6248ed0079c637793bd0661cdc1d282e7de2c98a616d28fb487f6a2d4fd39.jpg"],"size":0,"version":null},"70010000073237":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b290ea06fc6f8ba983bac4d335d9af2244de9249d80d87697fcda098526c4303.jpg","category":["Adventure"],"description":"STORY\n\n\u201cMachina\u201d is the world\u2019s first android to pass the Turing Test.

But when evil came to their world, they lost each other. Now both of them need to head towards each other, facing many difficulties and dangers along the way. And only by finding a fragile connection between one another and going hand in hand will they be able to defeat evil and meet again. It's a story about how we can help one another even when you're apart, and be far from one another even when you're nearby. It's a story about the importance of relationships and mutual support. But every story has an even deeper meaning...\n\nSPLIT SCREEN\nThe game works in splitscreen mode, with one character on each screen in their respective locations. The game has two modes. The first is single-player mode, where one player simultaneously controls both characters with one joystick. In this mode, the player must demonstrate sophisticated controller skills. The second is local co-op mode, where two players control the characters using two joysticks. Here, both players control their respective characters. Each mode has its advantages. Single-player mode requires you to show great dexterity and reaction speed, and co-op mode allows you to feel the joy of playing the game with your family or friend. Try both game modes, we hope you'll like it and enjoy completing it.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH AND HELP EACH OTHER\nEach character has their own part of the level in a common location. However, some parts of the level are interconnected. This means that the characters can interact and help each other complete the level. Characters can move keys and objects from one part of the screen to another, and most puzzles are need to be solved by both characters working together, connecting parts of the screen and solving puzzles together.\n\nEPIC BOSSES\nThe game has epic boss battles. Each boss represents the world of shadows that has invaded this fairytale forest and wants to plunge all the inhabitants of this fairytale world into the horror of eternal darkness. Our brave heroes, Lina and Minho, must defeat each of the bosses so that peace and prosperity will once again reign in the fairy forest. Boss battles take place without splitscreen, and are designed to be played by just one of the characters, so each character must defeat their evil shadow bosses.\n\nPUZZLES\nOn their way through the collapsing fairy-tale world, the characters will constantly encounter various puzzles like closed doors, laser beams with reflectors, ancient mechanisms and ruins, labyrinths, and caves full of dangers. Our heroes will be able to overcome all difficulties, but each will have to make every effort to pass these trials and help their companion.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/beefd17912b6e3c4b4f95387a73599e9cafa20bb4f0c8735b25b2c118a44abe8.jpg","id":"01002CB01CEE8000","intro":"Immerse yourself in the ethnic world of two heroes, solve puzzles and overcome obstacles together, explore the fairy forest and other locations, help each other.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","it","ru","zh"],"name":"Hand in Hand","nsuId":70010000072271,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"OverGamez","rating":7,"ratingContent":["Fear","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240511,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f531cb8bcdf5dc5e8d09211dc8bb21fde5190fab37d3af30e8f1b7d246c4797b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/49d124826986ea1c28a9987ec7ba2a555707d0d6c5426ff2f0254ceb50c2e0ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4f8a382bbb12a540c98ce919f840f96f975ed77e020d006f699b0ed405c48dfc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f28ddbc10923154b3a7866bbabba0664894ecce5ed69e1258db3fbacc71c052d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4c4db6fd1fe4ecd9edb2f670846de0b9b9375f3979829aa3b8083664fca3b852.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2dc32626c6cecdf727446ae5a5159061fb1d73932836817424710cd69988f5a9.jpg"],"size":785383424,"version":null},"70010000079891":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/648ba78a5fba67e40e45a30fe42886b13319acaac62a7ebc968ac61d20709153.jpg","category":["Shooter","Arcade","Strategy","Action"],"description":"Defend against an onslaught of zombies in MergeZ \n\nMerge guns together to create new upgraded weapons \n\nArm your soldier and take out the zombie swarms","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/743995602e04ecfa89ac1164f409881b28b884de14c5876853e9d4377a81b5ff.jpg","id":"01001E401EC0A000","intro":"Merge guns to stop the zombies","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"MergeZ","nsuId":70010000079891,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Entity3","rating":7,"ratingContent":["Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240511,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/55f337583e7ac4cb4e8ed65ac092f00b9c7fefc3e7e1b05a180f46a821e6c221.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/767713493222528bb64f8dd9c6914c6f051c3315efe249110e233b9ec83ad266.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/97e02fa515ff70033651e8e6c853e8e314890259efb22dfa9ac0570a3c55047b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2ebd2a404143356f0686b4da0983147a7e73667fff8ea743908ca1f25737a970.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4581af5a12dd13423cedd3c96f6cb9450bcd30c724efab8cb4f1258610b362b9.jpg"],"size":160432128,"version":null},"70010000080301":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/1c6c95dcad745249a4c40f0ca5e3438e136668478d2eae4fb49f044073d90dff.jpg","category":["Simulation","Adventure","Arcade","Lifestyle"],"description":"Welcome to the Culinary Cooking Master Simulator,  where you embark on a delicious journey to become the ultimate culinary masterchef!

Instead, a decade of war and famine has left China in ruin, and its salvation seems to lie in the hands of a Mohist swordsman who gains control of a fabled artifact called the Elysium Scroll.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
