As a chosen traveler, the player's goal is to defeat the beasts and restore peace to Babylon.\n\nThe game features a side-view action RPG style.

Mastering this technique can make battles more efficient. Additionally, the game allows you to adjust the speed across four levels, so if fast-paced action isn't your strong suit, you can play at your preferred pace.\n\nThere's no money or shop system, and players progress by collecting scattered items and magic across the wide map, offering a simple and accessible gameplay experience. However, weapons and shields are automatically equipped upon discovery, so be sure to compare new items with your current gear before picking them up. If you do accidentally equip the wrong item, you can re-enter the room to re-equip your previous gear, so no worries!\n\nIn this game, you\u2019ll explore the field, power up with hidden items and magic, and defeat beasts. Despite its simplicity, the smooth action makes for an enjoyable experience.\n\nFor a nostalgic touch, the game manual even includes plenty of monster illustrations.

Use your demonic companion to traverse and survive in a desolate, demon-ridden Osaka.\n\n- As Shin defeats demons and levels up, new skills can be unlocked via skill tree. Unlock the \"Warp\" skill to travel anywhere on the map or a double-jump to get up to higher ledges and explore new locations with ease.\n\n- Lux isn't the only weapon in your arsenal. In addition to his main firearm, Shin can wield other weapons such as greatswords and whips. Experiment with a variety of armaments and create your own style of combat.\n\n- Explore a map far larger than past Team Ladybug projects, filled with side quests that both deepen your connection to and expand upon the world of \"Blade Chimera\".\n\nThe Story :\nIt all began with the sudden appearance of a ghastly demonic horde. Humans fought against ghouls and ghosts in what would later be known as the \"Demon War,\" and the world was changed forever.\nThirty years later, using their expertise in combatting demons, a religious group called the \"Holy Union\" has carved out a small but stable enclave of survivors.\n\n\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d565604db5c1d413991ca8504844ec4281aa255eec0a685cc9170480a9a57673.jpg","id":"01007FC01CF4E000","intro":"You are Shin, a demon hunter.

will awaken the magic within you, and you will free us from the R\u00eave...\n\nSet in a wondrously evocative re-imagining of France, a beautifully crafted otome visual novel following Emma, orphaned at a young age, as she fights to uncover her forgotten memories. A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Bad Language","Sex"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70010000082747":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/31090b492494ae8ebd2e475b550abd4b486f3f54530f7a336ce6de440c8f5ef5.jpg","category":["Adventure","RPG"],"description":"The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022\u2019s most acclaimed RPGs!\n\nYou are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body. You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.\n\nPUSH YOUR LUCK\nEach character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success.\n\nNAVIGATE THE BELT\nChart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Starward Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.\n\nDO THE JOB, GET PAID\nContracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FUTURE\nPlayer choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/efb3c6044459819a30ca308e2b3329c1a036ed0b9cf8d66b620cf42bd3541c71.jpg","id":"0100B4001F81C000","intro":"A DICE DRIVEN RPG","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector","nsuId":70010000082747,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Fellow Traveller","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Mild Swearing"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/37122921fb7e539387a6dfdbe5e762de66351cc6119a87f6dc7c0fe963947be8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3f733b94db8c3b21124b61897e38543453a79b1bc24bd1e883d4631d4fe8112c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/165ddc1c5aff50e413f7e6e3a53da661f643d0ba374ef8ddbe46461aa7b174ce.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4a25dc42335abc9cb54a30c69b8d428824ebba5ff079d558cce9735c0cf9d011.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c5245bd72442d480208197ed82a063e41949ff247585e57ef95e135ac9398a64.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e0feaac95f280674eace09b1b076dbb01e696bc4862e5a13cbf2bef123f5c0b4.jpg"],"size":632291328,"version":null},"70050000052465":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/786f0b737d8892c7c2af512af6ca42dcde85fc2928287d590ce5347078fb8f1f.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enjoy a new original scenario, including new quests and stories.\n\nNote:\n- This product is scheduled to become available by the end of January 2025.\n\n- Content can be accessed after reaching a designated point in the game.\n- The details and release dates of any content may be changed with no notice.

Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience.
