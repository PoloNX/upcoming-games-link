The interesting part is that moving to the right does not necessarily mean a stronger weapon, and you need to instantly assess the numbers and contents of the gauge. If you fail to power-up, you may end up weakening.\n\nThe game is also known for its high difficulty level. It's a game with some quirks, but it is undeniably satisfying to master.

To address this dire situation, the President of Sanlar issues a special order to the 12th Special Armoured Corps.

It's a side-scrolling shooter where players pilot the Leynos assault suit against a relentless mechanized army, featuring a hard-boiled story and robot-anime inspired gameplay. Assault Suit Leynos spawned the beloved spinoff Assault Suit Valken (known as Cybernator) that is set in the same universe. It was released for the Super NES\u2122 in 1992 and is a must-have for every fan of 2D robot action!\n\nA myriad of offensive options\nSelect your assault suit and arm yourself from a diverse arsenal as you navigate through 7 challenging stages.

In each level, you\u2019ll navigate across tiles, flipping each tile to proceed to the next. Make sure you don\u2019t jump while the eye\u2019s watching, or you\u2019ll be zapped away in a flash. If you make it across the tiles, you\u2019ll race down a tube blasting away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you. And you have to do all this inside of the 3D space of Minter\u2019s kaleidoscopic visualizer.\n\nDon\u2019t get too comfortable, Minter has also thrown in some arena levels that challenge you to pick out and blast an onslaught of lethal enemies.\n\nAt its core it is a game that only Llamasoft could have made.

Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark?
