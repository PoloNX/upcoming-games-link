The fate of the next migration was entrusted to the REINBOW Nebula. However, the REINBOW Nebula consisted of six planets with completely different environments, all ruled by a single governing planet\u2014and they viewed humanity as an absolute enemy. As time flowed, a mysterious soldier raced through the unknown. When he laid eyes on an armored suit with five radiant lights, his destiny was forever changed.\n\nInto the Future (From the Player's Manual)\n\nThis is an action RPG originally released in 1986 in Japan. Players take on the role of the aforementioned mysterious soldier and embark on an adventure across six planets.\n\nThe game features a side-view action RPG format, where each planet consists of two stages: an aerial stage with a shooting-based playstyle and an underground stage where hand-to-hand combat and action mechanics come into play. Key locations, such as underground entrances and the end of each stage, feature formidable boss battles. By uncovering their weaknesses, players can experience thrilling and tense encounters.\n\nThe game's difficulty is notably high. In aerial combat, running out of fuel causes health to gradually deplete, and when it reaches zero, it's game over. Thus, managing fuel stations as central bases for resupply is essential. On stages where refueling isn't possible, players must carefully select a low-power thruster to conserve fuel. Proper fuel management is a critical technique for survival. Additionally, some stages lack shops altogether, making it crucial to stock up on necessary items beforehand.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5bbc008454efb87f4e00b112473fd1137b6789f50dffe726d808e6d82527eb75.jpg","id":"0100E79022DBA000","intro":"A shooting game depicting a rescue drama set in an underwater city.

By strapping a piece of buttered toast to a cat's back, you create a paradox that results in an infinitely spinning, floating butter-cat perpetual motion machine!\nThe game revolves around the two main characters, \"Cat\" and \"Buttered Toast.\" You'll need to use the interactions between them to solve various puzzles at each game level. The full game is featuring over 140 main levels and more than 60 side levels. There are also hidden rooms, challenging boss battles, and fun mini-games. The full version will include an outfit system, with 30+ Cat and Toast skins waiting for you to collect!\n\nCat and Toast Joint Adventure:\n\u30fbControl the cat as it runs left and right, climbs the cat scratching broad, and even slips through pipes. Hey! cats are liquid!\n\u30fbGuide the toast meanwhile with the cat, as toast jumps like projectiles. Hold down and power on, and the toast will jump farther!\n\u30fbWhen the two combine, they can trigger the paradox, taking the cat to unreachable places!\n\nWhimsical Contraptions:\nCATO will take you to a brain-teasing adventure, exploring five different worlds, each filled with unique contraptions.\nIncluding toaster(Toast: NO!!)to buttered trampolines and speed-boasting space pipes(Cat: Meow!!). Along the way, the two will also encounter some mysterious companions to help them with puzzles.\n\nBoss Fights & Mini-Games:\nThe game is about puzzles, with a little action elements. You don't need to perform difficult platforming for most of the time; just focus on solving the puzzles. However, some pesky enemies will be standing in your way during the adventure. Your abilities will help you defeat them.\nAs you progress through the adventure, you'll also unlock various mini-games. Once collected, these can be installed on the gaming console in your little hideout, allowing you to play them anytime.\n\nEaster eggs and More:\nIn the world of CATO: Buttered Cat, there are many hidden rooms that can only be accessed through secret passages. Here, you can find Easter eggs from other worlds and mysterious drop items.\nTake them back to your cozy little hideout, put on your favourite outfit, and set off again!\n\nWhat exactly is the cat and toast searching for?

Stratogun is a modern interpretation of the arcade classics of the 80's. It's easy to pick up, but very difficult to master. Shoot your way through of swarms of enemies, unlock weapons ships & perks to increase your chances of survival. Can you conquer the coveted top spot in the leaderboard, or will you die trying?\n\nAt its core Stratogun is an ultra-fast space shooter with tight controls. The game also includes progression as after each run your score is converted to experience points which in turn unlock new gear. Every unlocked item will increase your chances of survival, but in the end it will all boil down to your skills and reaction time. The Red Orbit is ruthless, and only the toughest space pilots will survive the increasingly difficult waves of blood-thirsty enemies.\n\nThe visuals of Stratogun draw influence from the arcade classics. Wireframe aesthetics are combined with a kick-ass soundtrack ensuring that this would indeed be something you'd find in an arcade, if those establishments would still be a thing.\n\nKey Features:\n\u2022 Uncompromised arcade gameplay & difficulty\n\u2022 Modern, yet arcade-faithful audiovisuals\n\u2022 Progression & unlockable gear\n\u2022 Leaderboards\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f74d06eaa3051c3eef48f0d4b287d48c64fbd3612013e0622ed55e56c77dcbbc.jpg","id":"01000C4022986000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","pt","es","fr","de","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Stratogun","nsuId":70010000095968,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Numskull Games","rating":7,"ratingContent":["Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250506,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4740855211543c3fd67891e8553ab388c80d73d180c132fa8fa4f7650097670e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9a70e7a9ec8d187a2341d9faa8a724667f2ba3be5a905eee6b167d65a8cf4f32.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/496544533f58bb5730c94e6dc52a9d2d472f22a41fed3f3e13e2d0cf2208d83a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bb6e35b715b2268d84d9e695b1f5a9e47f0848004aad86eef55c6d1c4122736c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0d3635bb0bc1ec7919a6a6fda2d6c33e1a91983fd4d1996bf49ef15cff022dc1.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/97f2e58cfafd3911684fa9a6fb01dcadb539accaaa22a86c1b5093b703ccd3c0.jpg"],"size":268435456,"version":null},"70010000092434":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6df94488990efe508f740545d6593ee2889b9bd0fb1dea8b7cdb8095606874e4.jpg","category":["Simulation","Strategy"],"description":"Story Background\nThe thousand-year-old Galactic Empire collapses under the attack of alien creatures.

Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end \u2013 but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin.

The Frogs join the effort to push back the storm, bringing their skill with stone masonry and love for water with them. Meanwhile, a changing of the tides has unlocked new potential in the distance \u2013 the Coastal Groves have finally become accessible after countless cycles spent under the deluge. Though they remain isolated and hard to reach, the ancient, submerged settlements of the area hold great treasures waiting to be uncovered. Meanwhile, unique opportunities present themselves in the once-thriving forests left barren by the march of industry \u2013 the Ashen Thicket is littered with broken trunks and remnants of a past age, awaiting a masterful Viceroy to restore its forgotten glory.\n\nAgainst the Storm - Keepers of the Stone includes:\n- Welcome the dignified Frogs to your settlements and take advantage of their proficiency with stone masonry, the comfort they take in rainwater, and their ability to increase the rate at which new citizens join your settlements.\n- Explore the new Coastal Grove biome where settlements start along the water, far from the easy reach of royal envoys and the benefits they provide. Rely instead on the Strider Port building \u2013 unique to the Coastal Grove biome, it allows you to launch expeditions seeking treasures buried in the surrounding waters. The Strider Port offers a fresh way to seek out new building designs with each expedition simply requiring a supply of food for the Water Strider and its rider alike \u2013 the more you\u2019re willing to invest in supplies, the better your potential finds might be.\n- Brave the new Ashen Thicket biome, ravaged by industrial exploitation and the Blightstorm alike. The barren lands here are home to the rare Thunderblight Shards \u2013 lightning-infused crystals that can be mined at great cost, crucial for forging Cornerstones using the Ashen Thicket\u2019s unique Cornerstone Forge building. With only a limited number of opportunities to produce your own Cornerstones, you must strategically choose which conditions and rewards go hand-in-hand, with the option to take on penalties in the hopes of bolstering their benefit.\n- New rewards are added to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City to benefit the new Frog species alongside 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 1 new Epic Cornerstone, 3 new Rare perks, and 5 new Uncommon perks.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends. To unlock Frogs as a playable species, you must reach level 9.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"010062F01F2CD001","ids":["010062F01F2CD001"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Against the Storm - Keepers of the Stone","nsuId":70050000056101,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Bad Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f8f9d0fafe7fdf346fb6e94becd111ceb04d69cce21ca266ad3b7eaacb8edcca.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/20f1324c8c52a4033714815173337b2dedbe3548da6bd34cd9e7fc355c591d18.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e530107176554b65628cdfe449d36986f3c67e3c452698bd011c5025d0757335.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6fb7dde72ff848922c69f6c80a868f80be58be49af7ee564fa741c8424d50af0.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/eab4adeaf08e09fb0d5b7ecc4b3ab4658c4ead633770bbc6a5c3ccb763bd399c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6729fe301aa4502772875bfa6620b9037da52e0e8e5f16b1fd0c55b8411d93ee.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000056189":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a2e0ca99a83822d414d86e1f4433d73afc2946b226a48457d86c3e60e0b8a794.jpg","category":null,"description":"This DLC unlocks a brand new world for hexceed: Flavum! \nPuzzle your way through 145 brand-new levels!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":"Unlocks a new world for hexceed: Flavum brings 145 new puzzles and includes all mechanics from the previous DLC.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"Flavum","nsuId":70050000056189,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"ToastieLabs","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7b53b18da29033fb288a86e03224ba2c04c900150b071b89a514456d33ded0c9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/8f6c21729e48026153c9f0b05a032b99ba5dbb037a851a59c207b6c45a6979b8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ba45b1606fac22889cd25aeebaa06044e1f745fd4441b4be1312745539d1763f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/01004865980160bbd135e4cbf5dc1f57547da7762f26b870fd689898d95993af.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d7336384e8a2fc585c4bb71c89dd5e9ceabdaf8e3ae012f2424323f60267cf1b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/50f67cc8179bb567155c1090b5d581038461b879d7a48d6872e11e33699a4271.jpg"],"size":3145728,"version":null},"70070000025387":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/498bfeac8af0614538594381fe3e86782f58eb5c6448323c34eda7a26272a9c3.jpg","category":null,"description":"Pre-purchase and receive:\n\n- Early Access - get the game 3 days early*\n- Wireframe Tony Shader\n\nPurchase the Digital Deluxe Edition to skate as the Doom Slayer and rip and tear through a ton of additional content.\n\nThe Digital Deluxe Edition includes:\n\n- The Doom Slayer and The Revenant playable skaters, each includes 2 secret moves.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names.
