Immerse yourself in this dark fantasy world and show the demons who's the power to be reckoned with.\n\nExciting journeys to various locations!\nSeveral huge levels are generated from manually created parts. Each level is an independent biome with its own unique atmosphere, mysteries and dangerous creatures. Secret rooms, hidden passages, breathtaking landscapes, and lots of valuable things that can be encountered in unexpected places provide a real incentive to explore the environment.\n\nBosses from the netherworld!\nAt the end of each level, you will meet powerful monsters that guard the passages to the next locations, preventing you from following the book.

As well as a full 3D first-person game, with hacking, exploration, stealth elements, and more puzzles to solve.\n\nIMPRESSIVE VOICE CAST\nYuri Lowenthal (Spider-Man 1 & 2, Prince of Persia The Sands of Time, Call of the Sea), Krizia Bajos (Cyberpunk 2077, League of Legends) and Cissy Jones (Firewatch, Life is Strange, Call of the Sea), among others, breathe life into the characters in American Arcadia.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4941790c9e1c650173e992ca1ae273b96bbd9e40078a3b5be13c8a675b8a6500.jpg","id":"01003A70209AE000","intro":"Welcome to Arcadia!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","ru","ko","zh"],"name":"American Arcadia","nsuId":70010000087158,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Raw Fury","rating":16,"ratingContent":["Strong Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250515,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a14316fd2f9f0c1207065a9e5f901958cd4724c722555a2a7757c40cbe43e54e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/83ce9c526fc63c51d765ffddf5ca7a23ffcdbe0628cbe9045237c1b40a055b90.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5fdcdc83976b3f900e37b907b8e7e8e49ee57260dfde1be1f3b5098f33fec749.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ccc6d23ba6f27f4228d799635a360c03009333e8ffbe99cb2407adc86bff24d5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/688f9eaa664cb10514f2dfaa08b5d8c5416a3445a06fa803ebe22acedf657171.jpg"],"size":5014290432,"version":null},"70010000087632":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2c53bfb44772a2181f00660e627092763479561ffd35bd9d637aff0802670140.jpg","category":["Adventure"],"description":"The remote town of Okunezato is shaped like a crescent moon and shrouded in dark myths and legends. \n\nTake on the role of a brave young woman journeying into the unknown to uncover dangerous truths and locate her missing brother with her childhood friend. \n\nThey find the area rife with mystery and populated by intriguing characters, each harboring their own hidden motivations. \n\nEncounter heart-racing twists and turns as you dig deeper into the story.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aacacbf6ccc5675c765bd9709e83f1c76e44b95202e2231bdf57d44a929030ec.jpg","id":"0100C0D020B00000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"7'scarlet","nsuId":70010000087632,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Aksys Games","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Bad Language"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250515,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/85c1c51cc88cadfb277e67d1c19ba25dced1e9eea144e583be6dcfcf82f23471.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d69d02c1ab1f556628423d2b506f4773c336718c06de342b4bdebb3cf3d5015f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/944fc2ed4a294a98f1d5d7cd1620e3493d79588a1932520d434006b13466cae7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c74862a07e245aa15061a13bef89e5af41bea69dd99ef6f17e6cc1b66cdbc2dc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b5433f7f4e87465b88c859090f3a5337798d732643cb02d3b2a75f7137c4e989.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/20d2fc0d80a44e413137c4c480f9a93a3d309dbaaef5160ff831d3be0c55b4dc.jpg"],"size":2829058048,"version":null},"70010000087950":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c53dc2a3f7885b296bb91040d72dd9fd1d88372834506fa32fecccffbddec7e9.jpg","category":["Adventure","Puzzle","Other"],"description":"Boxville 2 continues the adventure of cans living in a box city.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names.
