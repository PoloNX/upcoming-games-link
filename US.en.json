Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end \u2013 but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\n\nBUILD AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF CITIES\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/826e32bcdd2337d3db30beb6ee97a0f412b77c8fbad04dfc2ecbdb12ee50cd90.jpg","id":"010062F01F2CC000","intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","pt","fr","de","it","ru","ko","zh","zh"],"name":"Against the Storm","nsuId":70010000081349,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Hooded Horse","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Alcohol Reference","Fantasy Violence","Language","Mild Blood","Use of Tobacco","In-Game Purchases"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250626,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aaca9d684f2e362c492feee0f8fa2a79eac58e785d61b7cd149b2d85325147dc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cc7fb0bdb90a3cd2683264a45f728f7fbf765bdcdbb02feafb5120222eb3f5e2.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/13a5eb288f4ea7779a33e79ac94e6b3b4afca1cd459feb2172f974c3dda7a7f5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3e6fd272cd6df26d63ac4ad4ac59553798e05ec1e9940bfc59b569d4e43fff20.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7502b7d812d79066d263bf8b9289e299a647113e0b83b052e32ddc499c331f6a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cf8ed8d8dad38075a8a6344e3debaa6f5e10a67d415cce340055b964d6894dc6.jpg"],"size":2134900736,"version":null},"70010000096547":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b2c6e74a5a329af1101738befcb37ddafcbb8b899964173524bb91808877fb96.jpg","category":["Arcade","Simulation","Video"],"description":"This game is a drone simulation game that allows you to experience real drone flight based on footage shot by a real flying drone. \nThere is no up, down, left or right direction control, only the control to increase or decrease the drone speed. \nYou can also change the drone's flight mode from Normal, Sport, and Eco to any of the 3. \n\nEnjoy the beautiful scenery of Dongmak Beach, Korea with \"Real\" footage! \nThere are a total of 2 flight courses. \nHigh-definition footage faithfully reproduces the atmosphere of real nature, providing a strong sense of immersion in the game. \nSmooth and realistic video playback makes you feel like you are a real drone pilot. \nLarge capacity!

The Frogs join the effort to push back the storm, bringing their skill with stone masonry and love for water with them. Meanwhile, a changing of the tides has unlocked new potential in the distance \u2013 the Coastal Groves have finally become accessible after countless cycles spent under the deluge. Though they remain isolated and hard to reach, the ancient, submerged settlements of the area hold great treasures waiting to be uncovered.

Rely instead on the Strider Port building \u2013 unique to the Coastal Grove biome, it allows you to launch expeditions seeking treasures buried in the surrounding waters. The Strider Port offers a fresh way to seek out new building designs with each expedition simply requiring a supply of food for the Water Strider and its rider alike \u2013 the more you\u2019re willing to invest in supplies, the better your potential finds might be.\n- Brave the new Ashen Thicket biome, ravaged by industrial exploitation and the Blightstorm alike. The barren lands here are home to the rare Thunderblight Shards \u2013 lightning-infused crystals that can be mined at great cost, crucial for forging Cornerstones using the Ashen Thicket\u2019s unique Cornerstone Forge building. With only a limited number of opportunities to produce your own Cornerstones, you must strategically choose which conditions and rewards go hand-in-hand, with the option to take on penalties in the hopes of bolstering their benefit.\n- New rewards are added to the upgrade tree in the Smoldering City to benefit the new Frog species alongside 3 new Legendary Cornerstones, 1 new Epic Cornerstone, 3 new Rare perks, and 5 new Uncommon perks.\n- The new biomes will appear on the world map after the current cycle ends.
