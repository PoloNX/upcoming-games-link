A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070243,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mild Language","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70010000082746":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/31090b492494ae8ebd2e475b550abd4b486f3f54530f7a336ce6de440c8f5ef5.jpg","category":["Adventure","RPG"],"description":"The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022\u2019s most acclaimed RPGs!\n\nYou are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body.

Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel.

Thankfully, their friend and fellow vigilante Casey Jones is always ready to pick up his hockey stick and do some damage. What's more, he happens to know a shortcut to the rooftops of NYC! Strangely, their path takes them straight through the Junkyards and Punk Frog turf. Could this have anything to do with Casey\u2019s missing ride?\nThey are no match for Casey, though\u2013 what he lacks in finesse he more than makes up for in raw power. His Slapshot becomes the first ranged attack in the game, taking down punks left and right.\n\nWELCOME TO THE JUNKYARD\n\nAfter defeating Karai, you have your choice to enter the Streets, or try your luck in the Junkyard. The Junkyard brings an all new narrative starring Casey, the Punk Frogs, their mechanic, Gigi, and a surprise Punk Frog encore.\nWhile a junkyard wouldn\u2019t normally feel homey, the Punk Frogs have settled in and made it their own. The warmth from the blazing barrel fires, the completely non-toxic pools of water, the artistry of Frog graffiti peppering the landscape. What could be better?\nMake sure you visit Gigi\u2019s Chop Shop, the Crane Vista, and complete your stay with a lively bop in the Battlebot Arena.\n\nNEW ENEMIES AND CHALLENGING BOSSES\n\nThe Punk Frogs continue to test your patience while you make your way through the Junkyard. The crafty Attila has cobbled together repurposed versions of Stockgen robots to wreak all kinds of havoc. Gigi, the vivacious toad mechanic and a threat the Turtles and their friends have never before faced, wields her sawblade with ferocity to make for a challenging mid-run foe. Your ultimate Junkyard challenge will be Ghenghis\u2019 mech bot, The Junkinator, wielding every weapon the Frogs can find.\n\nNEW WAYS TO PLAY\n\nEarn 5 new Artifacts and explore using Casey\u2019s inspirations, masteries, and tool across your runs with other characters! Artifacts include some helpful additions for Multiplayer runs and new ways to stun enemies. Casey\u2019s suite of powers help him excel with his Special ability, Guard Break, and many more surprises.\n\nCO-OP MADNESS\n\nYour friends don\u2019t own Casey Jones & the Junkyard yet? No problem.

It's a sleek, streamlined experience with just two buttons\u2014fire and bomb\u2014making it easy to pick up but hard to master. What sets the game apart is the tilt mechanic: as you turn, your shots tilt slightly left or right, allowing for strategic, angled attacks. You also have a small, satellite-like option unit that shoots independently. However, charging it requires you to release the fire button for a while, creating a tactical ebb and flow rarely seen in this all-out shoot 'em up genre.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\nThere\u2019s a big difference between an arcade game and one you play at home, and Under Defeat has gotten several new additions since its arcade debut in 2005. The New Order Mode adapts the game to a modern 16:9 format, and the game has received both sharper textures and four selectable soundtracks. This includes a brand new one from original composer Shinji Hosoe, known for his work on Ridge Racer, Tekken, Street Fighter EX, SuperSweep among many others. Of course, for an authentic experience, you can still play Under Defeat in its original arcade format. How you enjoy this bombastic action fest is entirely up to you! \n\nA BLAST FROM THE PAST\nUnder Defeat is a true classic. The game first appeared in arcades, developed by G.rev and released in Japan almost two decades ago. Over the years, it has made its way to several platforms. Most notably, it was released on the Dreamcast in 2006\u2014long after official support for the console had ended. This 2024 edition is the ultimate version of the game, containing all previous content, meticulously ported by genre veterans. \n\nNEVERENDING WAR\nUnder Defeat doesn\u2019t throw you into an incomprehensible sci-fi universe that make no sense. Instead, it offers a (mostly) realistic depiction of a futuristic past. Specifically, you play as a helicopter pilot in a drawn-out war between the German-speaking Empire and the English-speaking Union, a conflict that has raged for over a decade. Both sides are exhausted, with heavy losses on each side, yet peace remains elusive. Will this destructive conflict ever end? You'll have to play to find out!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d615b3e1f60176e1b43594db713ca8b3bc3611ed70fd06564002963d5ecfa2f9.jpg","id":"0100E1301FEDC000","intro":"FIGHT FOR PEACE IN THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF AN ALL-TIME CLASSIC!\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it"],"name":"Under Defeat","nsuId":70010000084449,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"Clear River Games","rating":10,"ratingContent":["Mild Suggestive Themes","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250206,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/80dab6c84efc51e64d3a02bd7e8cca426fcf3f47ce389a122972c59455c90ce9.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/03ae49541d214fde07ee4862cda34aa2fc9680512e126a7a80aea90c06824d6b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/600a499f513c46859446b66c65ae496f8928c2db94efe994e3f12c265d2701c3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/cafacf52f1064941c40d522e4fdf576a69c481d020e625365f8933959f085810.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f88370f0981c24397f3b7e63b0ab692f19383f9996d0b89f965bddb2f1c3726d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9ff0f07f4fe0d481a38311b80aa5a9a4eaf7723d911fcf9f61c5a6ead3190106.jpg"],"size":364904448,"version":null},"70010000087192":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/811d59acb0a6fcf5671684046b234423b0ba10e447766b382655748eb9618f26.jpg","category":["Arcade","Puzzle","Shooter","Board Game"],"description":"The ultimate marble shooter game combines puzzle-solving skills with fast-paced action.

In addition to him remastering his original works, we have created six entirely new tracks as well.\n\nRemembered:\nAnd it's not just Chris H\u00fclsbeck who has returned for this remake: Ogan Kandemiroglu, the brother and co-artist of Celal Kandemiroglu who created the original iconic key art of X-Out, took on that task for the remake as a tribute.\n\nRe-equipped:\nThe shop system is back and thoroughly improved as well: new preconfigured load-outs allow you to jump straight into the action, added item descriptions help new cadets configure and build their fleet, and we've FINALLY marked the available slots for your weaponry.\n\nReinforced:\nShould you still feel overwhelmed by X-Out\u2019s challenge, then maybe it\u2019s time for a co-captain. Enlist a friend and face the terrors from the ocean deep together in the local 2-player co-op mode!\n\nReversed:\nIf you think you\u2019ve seen everything there is to the game already, then prepare to have your bearing changed and your gyro twisted in the Mirror Mode with its reverse-scrolling levels!\n\nRecapped:\n\u2022 Experience a fresh but faithful take on a real shoot-\u2019em-up classic!\n\u2022 Get dazzled by the new and beautiful sprite work mixed with shiny particle and lighting effects!\n\u2022 Take a journey through new and old synth soundscapes courtesy of composer legend Chris H\u00fclsbeck!\n\u2022 Choose one of three load-outs or build your own fleet in the improved shop system!\n\u2022 Grab a trusty ally and face the depths together in a 2-player couch co-op dive!\n\u2022 Get your world flipped, turned upside down in the Mirror Mode!\n\u2022 Too challenging? Don't fret we got some cheats for you to breeze through the game with ease!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0d4de6fefb16837f6844cb403c5968c02c177d4d7aa3618982f18b15baa3ae50.jpg","id":"010048501F73E000","intro":"Relive the deep-sea classic!

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe. From an underwater lab to dinosaur times and a marooned space station, each arena has its own special features.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/07f81cc8b45d09ba17b62492b8e1e4454c58c7c0f6e174c43aac60c4bfec5012.jpg","id":"010004502071E000","intro":"Dunk with or on your friends in Dunk Dunk, a multiplayer action basketball arcade party game full of chaotic fun.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","es","pt","en","fr","de","zh","zh"],"name":"Dunk Dunk","nsuId":70010000086482,"numberOfPlayers":4,"publisher":"Playtonic Friends","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/830804a8c0bc555b6494214f8366b955c41fbb1d9c2d80c7cadfd2a9b1387ec5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/11a7d23b1bee16c79d4403847bb45817634f70575a85f3faee8080a0026c7a89.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2288d2cc3166de5e76b7a2dd253a50c48b3d32546f95b96fb5767919774163ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b928e0880254a18a4ad499eed0e20be31ed2d885b71db50ace6d7a6969719ae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/f3e449b687971c77a89a791b8bab96f77fb855f4325142e7d1c2db29c9e8143c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5b0eadf4ce32ecb596c11014ee55ffead167ae9595feb6c8db57513e4d5e4b93.jpg"],"size":424673280,"version":null},"70050000046105":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df5e52844738f32f17e1654480187020ced34f51e902672540af805ea857719d.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7026","ids":["0100FBD013AB7026"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 15: Oil & Dirt","nsuId":70050000046105,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Users Interact"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000046109":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8e22033788d5f9c44aeb0820db8814c5ae1712b4c7898dc2f3eee21b26b4ead.jpg","category":null,"description":"Expand your SnowRunner experience with this new DLC.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":"0100FBD013AB7027","ids":["0100FBD013AB7027"],"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SnowRunner - Season 16: Expansion 4","nsuId":70050000046109,"numberOfPlayers":null,"publisher":"Focus Entertainment","rating":6,"ratingContent":["Users Interact"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251231,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":null,"size":3145728,"version":null},"70050000046223":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/233d71ca26ac382d7ab9a8e48c5fb4e2656687c72e59189588fc6e288b42a5d6.jpg","category":null,"description":"Get another Melee Weapon and more cosmetic items.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":null,"id":null,"intro":null,"isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":null,"name":"SOUTH PARK: SNOW DAY!
