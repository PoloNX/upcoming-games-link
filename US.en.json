Would you dare come face to face with the infamous 3x3 slide puzzle?\n\n- Varying battle mechanics to always keep the action fresh! - Many characters will switch up the tactics of battle, you'll be faced with various minigames based on the scenario you find yourself in.\n\n- Absolutely hilarious. - This game is fast paced, action packed, and full of zany and ironic humor that anyone can have a nice laugh at.\n\n- Lots of rabbit holes, secrets, and suspicious endeavors! - You will NOT run out of things to do. If you do, you probably haven't seen the sunlight in quite some time!\n\n- Choose your own adventure! - Nothing substantial in this game is up to RNG. You choose your pathway from start to finish, creating an extremely specific pathway which'll then be recorded - this is your playthrough's Rhapsody, a narrated story of your journey through Athens! When you come to the end of the line and reflect upon your Rhapsody, could you say you did your best?\n\n- Last but not least... An Online Social System!

I cried because I realized how painful it would be for the ones who love me.\"\n\nLoving Life is a short, non-fictional auto-biographical visual novel created in 2012 by Zhenghua Yang (Z), the founder of Serenity Forge, as a reflection on a near-fatal incident that changed his life. \n\n- Story -\n\nAt age 18, Z was a typical college student: driven by academic performance, struggling with family pressure, and wrestling with the viewpoints of his peers. However, as his first semester of college came to a close, his ordinary life would dissolve... with a 14 hour nosebleed and mere hours left to live.\n\nLoving Life is Z's honest reflection of this episode of his life, weaving between prose, dialogue, and dream, as he traverses the deadly space between his present life, his past, and whatever that may come next. \n\n- Features -\n\nLoving Life was the first product released under the Serenity Forge label, and it marks an origin for the studio's commitment to emotional honesty, artistic experimentation, and narrative exploration. To commemorate Serenity Forge's 10th anniversary, we remastered Loving Life with a raft of quality of life enhancements. Now, fans of the studio, new and old, can see where it all began.\n\n- A Personal Reflection: As an auto-biographical VN, Loving Life tells its story with equal parts poetic recollection and honest conclusions. Read Z's memories, follow his thoughts, and live through his dreams as he navigates this profound episode in his life.\n- Beautiful Visions: All of the game's art is hand-painted, from portraits of Z's friends to the surreal dreamscapes he traversed while in recovery. \n- The Origin Story of Serenity Forge: Experience a story that reveals the cultural foundation of Serenity Forge, and that itself is an example of the studio's experimentation with games as vessels for meaning and emotional impact.\n- Remastered for Modern Platforms: Play with modern conveniences such as font accessibility controls, audio controls, text speed adjustments, and select remastered assets, with corrections to visuals and rendering on modern monitors.

Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event.\n\nFrom the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely.\n\nYou must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates.\n\nHowever, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone?\n\nUltimately, everything is about choices and consequences.\n\nFeatures\n\nChoose how you want to follow the game\u2019s story.\n\nThe complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. \n\nYou can concentrate on just one particular character\u2019s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. \n\nYou can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline \u2013 essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause.\n\nOr you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses. \n\nWatch and change things as many times as you like\n\nCan\u2019t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you\u2019re not sure you like the consequences? That\u2019s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like.\n\nChange the past to affect the future\n\nSetting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events.

If you want to abolish all public spending and all taxes, you can do that. It might work, it might not, depending on how you handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to nationalise the railways, energy and water companies, cap CEO pay, ban second-home ownership, and put universal income in place, you can do that too.

What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
