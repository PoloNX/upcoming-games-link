Select a clan and attempt to settle this unwelcoming land, but you\u2019ll need to choose your strategy wisely to survive the ever increasingly harsh toll of winter and complete your saga.\n\nThe thrill of a dungeon crawler with the vibe of a city builder, Landnama is a survival strategy game that forces you to carefully decide your next step. Explore the land and discover hidden challenges and powerful landmarks. Build your settlement and brace for the punishing Winter\u2019s Toll. Settle each region with differently skilled clans while facing ever increasing challenges and no second chances.\n\nOnly one resource exists in the game, Heart, but it must be invested wisely. Heart can be gained in many ways, whether you want to focus on exploring the land as a hunting clan or by building your settlement into a thriving production hub. Establish a completed settlement before winter takes your final heart, but how you get there is up to you.\n\nThis isn't your typical Viking game, there is no combat or raiding. These are farmers, explorers, and builders. But conflict isn\u2019t missing, it comes in the form of a harsh winter that you\u2019ll need every bit of your focus to survive.\n\nLandnama is a taxing race against time with an ever present ticking clock pushing you always closer to winter, but it\u2019s also a beautiful world where you can freeze time and enjoy the atmospheric music and art.

Players of the original game will feel right at home on this relentless voyage, even with the addition of new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a chest-thumping new soundtrack.\n\nWhile the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr the Viking 2 also (mercifully, begrudgingly) offers modern quality-of-life options such as checkpoints, save states, and an undead mode. You decide how punishing your quest should be \u2013 but now anyone can be a viking!\n\nWith new and larger worlds inspired by Norse mythology, multiple endings, and a variety of ruthless bosses to conquer, Volgarr the Viking 2 expands and improves on the original in every way.

Backgrounds, characters and game mechanics are inspired by works and artistic styles, bringing the world of art in a playful and fun way.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b97d1e0c91e4c7b9b745b8be74d584867fc05f612d449da3465f58467002c83a.jpg","id":"0100EA801AB00000","intro":"Enter the world of Nubla through the paintings of the Thyssen Museum.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es","fr","de","it","pt"],"name":"Nubla","nsuId":70010000064428,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"GammeraNest","rating":6,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20240912,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d530f7974749eb54db6ec3a1d00fa9da8b26913e594570b58eda12ac4031d3fc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/29f7582edfa8ae1d2ddc8bf126cdbca510a7dbe0bd8b109b6f7fef6899e26ebe.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6503a30ac01698c6b1e2fce0ae7ef346a7a16460e6acc462a8fb3ee5c9b6b2ff.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b4f1741c483ad3c62a44d69d3a85696605140738fd0a02774e31b1241f81373b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/44c6c6acc8b11e3e3ade3d12fb740bed52b16f56e1945b0fbfd4a1f45fc16cae.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a71bf13ddc4be97f6b00e0ed563cdee80ba1f6faf5b5a316377176e88b4c8057.jpg"],"size":486539264,"version":null},"70010000064430":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/de267ce52f9d4cbb7927b2a569006a0838b8814247d2ba2e89f19002f18b2a02.jpg","category":["Adventure","Puzzle","Action","Education"],"description":"Nubla 2, continues the adventure of the characters we met in Nubla Episode 1 from the end of their boat trip.

Will you manage to ward off the Fog?\n\n\nInto the Fray is a fast action-shooter in the vein of Doom and Dark Messiah. The focus is on fast, bloody combat with satisfying feedback and environmental reactivity in a dark Lovecraftian story of civil strife. \n\nInto the Fray is part of the Skautfold Series and follows Usurper and Shrouded in Sanity but can be played on its own.\n\n\nStory\n\nThe story is set in 1899 on the island of Portland. Take control of Hito, Third Knight of the Empire, to investigate a missing royal and a rebellious faction called the Sons of Washington. Beware the descending Fog and lead the islanders in fending off the rebels and their Eldritch allies!\n\nGameplay\n\nExplore corpse-filled streets and dank cave systems or cleanse secret underground tunnels of the rituals aiming to grow the Fog\u2019s influence. As you search for a way to stop the ongoing destruction, you're sure to stumble upon some of the deepest, darkest secrets of the island.\n\nChoose from an arsenal of devastating top-of-the-line firearms: hand-cannons, triple-barrel shotguns, as well as prototype weaponry from the great Nikola himself.\n\nBreak just about anything, kick barrels of oil and set them on fire, or just straight up give the boot to your enemies and watch them trigger traps.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
