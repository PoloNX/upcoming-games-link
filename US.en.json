As a chosen traveler, the player's goal is to defeat the beasts and restore peace to Babylon.\n\nThe game features a side-view action RPG style. Players attack enemies by dashing into them while utilizing various items (magic) to fight. Depending on your positioning, it's even possible to attack enemies directly above you. Mastering this technique can make battles more efficient. Additionally, the game allows you to adjust the speed across four levels, so if fast-paced action isn't your strong suit, you can play at your preferred pace.\n\nThere's no money or shop system, and players progress by collecting scattered items and magic across the wide map, offering a simple and accessible gameplay experience. However, weapons and shields are automatically equipped upon discovery, so be sure to compare new items with your current gear before picking them up. If you do accidentally equip the wrong item, you can re-enter the room to re-equip your previous gear, so no worries!\n\nIn this game, you\u2019ll explore the field, power up with hidden items and magic, and defeat beasts. Despite its simplicity, the smooth action makes for an enjoyable experience.\n\nFor a nostalgic touch, the game manual even includes plenty of monster illustrations. Looking at these vintage-style images before playing is sure to get you in the right mood!\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0a533b6d6026f5eb59765f9465d038a88b67d1f6b5e4efd6d2945b1c074cbb5f.jpg","id":"010066C02104C000","intro":"A traveler guided by spirits rises to save Babylon.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance\n","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070243,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Mild Language","Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70010000082746":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/31090b492494ae8ebd2e475b550abd4b486f3f54530f7a336ce6de440c8f5ef5.jpg","category":["Adventure","RPG"],"description":"The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022\u2019s most acclaimed RPGs!\n\nYou are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body. You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.\n\nPUSH YOUR LUCK\nEach character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success.\n\nNAVIGATE THE BELT\nChart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Starward Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.\n\nDO THE JOB, GET PAID\nContracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FUTURE\nPlayer choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices. The future of your character is up to you.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/efb3c6044459819a30ca308e2b3329c1a036ed0b9cf8d66b620cf42bd3541c71.jpg","id":"0100B4001F81C000","intro":"A DICE DRIVEN RPG","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector","nsuId":70010000082746,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Fellow Traveller","rating":13,"ratingContent":["Drug Reference","Language","Use of Alcohol and Tobacco","Violent References"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/37122921fb7e539387a6dfdbe5e762de66351cc6119a87f6dc7c0fe963947be8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3f733b94db8c3b21124b61897e38543453a79b1bc24bd1e883d4631d4fe8112c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/165ddc1c5aff50e413f7e6e3a53da661f643d0ba374ef8ddbe46461aa7b174ce.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4a25dc42335abc9cb54a30c69b8d428824ebba5ff079d558cce9735c0cf9d011.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c5245bd72442d480208197ed82a063e41949ff247585e57ef95e135ac9398a64.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e0feaac95f280674eace09b1b076dbb01e696bc4862e5a13cbf2bef123f5c0b4.jpg"],"size":632291328,"version":null},"70050000052466":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/786f0b737d8892c7c2af512af6ca42dcde85fc2928287d590ce5347078fb8f1f.jpg","category":null,"description":"Enjoy a new original scenario, including new quests and stories.\n\nNote:\n- This product is scheduled to become available by the end of January 2025.\n\n- Content can be accessed after reaching a designated point in the game.\n- The details and release dates of any content may be changed with no notice.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
