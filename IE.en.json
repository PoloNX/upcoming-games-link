As the galaxy's (soon to be) premiere chef, it's up to you to seek out the finest ingredients from alien planets, cook delicious dishes, and serve them to customers in the comfort of your fully-customisable space trailer.\n\nExplore Alien Worlds\nThere's a whole universe of ingredients out there... if they don't eat you first. Explore distant planets, derelict space stations, and your own basement for plants, critters, and other tasty morsels.\n\nAlong the way, you'll come across space pirates, ancient ruins, and a suspiciously high number of recently abandoned restaurants. Keep an eye out for rare resources (and bits of random junk) that you can use to upgrade your gear, kitchen equipment, and spaceship.\n\nCook Up Cosmic Creations\nOnce your fridge is stocked with ingredients that have (mostly) stopped wriggling, it's time to flip the sign and start serving!\n\nCraft over 140 different dishes, from simple homestyle Beefle Skewers to the legendarily tricky Octoegg Surprise. Wow your customers with delicious food and speedy service, and you\u2019ll earn the Astronomical Culinary Excellence Stars that mark your path to intergalactic culinary success.\n\nAs your reputation grows, the customers start coming to you! Keep it flexible by continuing your delivery service or open up a sit-in restaurant with a constant flow of patrons. You're free to close the kitchen whenever adventure calls.\n\nSet a Stellar Ambiance\nYour space-trailer might not look too sharp from the outside, but she's got it where it counts. Take complete control of your interior with freely placeable decorations and an in-depth coloring system to create the restaurant of your dreams. Add new floors, create themed zones, and fill it with the furniture and props you find on your travels!\n\nServe the Nebula\nThe citizens of the Horseshoe Nebula are more than just hungry bellies (most of them, anyway). Get to know Zoe the scrap dealer, faded Space Ace Jack Bronzon, the definitely-not-alien barman Zlurka, and many more characters on your journey to interstellar culinary stardom. Unique recipes, side quests, and even romance awaits if you can satisfy your loyal customers.\n\nWith your new-found friends, you\u2019ll uncover the truth about your missing grandma and take on the might of Galactic Burger as they try to muscle in on your space-turf.\n\nSpace Chef features:\n- Over 140 delectable dishes to create from 100+ alien ingredients\n- 5 alien planets to explore, from the jungle-filled Lush to aquatic Bluegoonia\n- 180+ creatures and plants to hunt, harvest, and run away from\n- 100+ craftable items for your character, ship, and kitchen\n- 150+ furnishings and decorations to personalize your restaurant\n- Freedom to create your own menu, opening times, and service style \u2013 vegetarian and vegan included!\n- A zany cast of characters, including romanceable NPCs with their own favorite recipes and questlines\n- A thrilling story of adventure, betrayal, and mass-produced burgers","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/841efe2d524a5f55f4749013c17571cb735f833dad91726b1c745b157ce19df0.jpg","id":"0100E37023538000","intro":"Hunt, cook, and deliver cosmic cuisine to become the greatest chef in the nebula!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Space Chef","nsuId":70010000097069,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Kwalee","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251028,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9ee830e98d21837c3eaea4c5bab3c8d223a6f5bf6e87cfcb182d61536874f27b.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/77888611160afa1dcd5254638b852bc12a7eb03653d356e167f77d92ff89c16f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b8c568ac6125680cfd175636582a0eaab04f8ebd7f6e7e91f17472db9bbde1c6.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/9a9629b7aa196ebc08dbbe721453f34cad2138832eeb12b8afeb473a32b678f8.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e27281fa76a383eaa1339468510798d2c592c09095afe9b24b7fc5f84ad3be1c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e6de314305aed4aa10996701f01312d4652e5f6d4fa23ab142a8a023175cd98e.jpg"],"size":1153433600,"version":null},"70010000099976":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d6f0ab7fc5f9edc4c25cf2159e741739c3f4a70539215c02f004b9519dba1197.jpg","category":["Adventure"],"description":"Experience the Magical World like never before in Simon the Sorcerer Origins, the highly anticipated prequel to the cult classic Point-and-Click adventure series.

Each level introduces new layouts and patterns that make you think ahead, plan your moves, and find the perfect sequence to clear the board. You\u2019ll start small, with just one or two cars per puzzle. Soon enough, the challenge grows as more cars crowd the space, demanding careful strategies and creative solutions. No timers, no stress, just you, the bunny, and the satisfying click of every car finding its spot. Explore three unique biomes across 35 levels. The Garage is messy and filled with oil stains, tires, and barrels, marking the beginning of your rabbit\u2019s career. Then comes the Pit Stop, right next to the racetrack, with vibrant details like vegetation and advertisement signs. Finally, the Track Median sets the stage with scattered objects, cacti, and hints of crashes, making each puzzle feel alive. With its charming theme and smooth progression, Bunny Pit Stop is the perfect choice for puzzle lovers who want a relaxing yet engaging experience.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e8c3008ef723586ec1733232b59fa2095d3eb6685fcb1d1ec2fb17a448f42b69.jpg","id":"010015E024D18000","intro":"Smart moves keep the pit stop running","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","pt"],"name":"Bunny Pit Stop","nsuId":70010000103535,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Afil Games","rating":3,"ratingContent":[],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251029,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/004d3c304fc973da8814f5f086aa1e61371be79626fb6065fe51b0bf9c180418.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5f28ce5cdd5a4bd5c4c8e2bc23c69df05c7b1cd2e99869d4e12974f7a012000a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ad8c3088f0abfb15cdc2b4d818419f02b53bb1d76e4b2fe7de02d98d8ac37132.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/90f62ea4fb24504e6c600287643789f789ac6b6d5613503ab0de3d4b557153e3.jpg"],"size":77594624,"version":null},"70010000105748":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/77345df0a7a24098b7f64dfed24d5520476229c396e66961e8428a3d7c373477.jpg","category":["Simulation","Racing","Arcade","Action"],"description":"The acclaimed \u201cTrain Plus\u201d series returns with its latest installment \u2014 now more deluxe than ever!  \n\u2666 More buildings for a richer cityscape experience!  \n\u2666 Create your own timetable and run trains exactly as you like!  \n\u2666 The master controller (mascon) is now 14-level \u2014 enjoy realistic driving!  \n\u2666 Compatible with \u201cDensha de GO!!

Harold series, following \"MURDER CLUB\" (1986) and \"Manhattan Requiem\" (1987). However, as indicated by the phrase \u201canother story of MANHATTAN REQUIEM\u201d on the title screen, it is not a numbered sequel but rather a parallel story to the second game, \"Manhattan Requiem.\"\n\nThe story centers on the theft of \"The Blue Lament\" sapphire from a jewelry store, driven by complex human relationships and intricate deductions. This title introduces the \"Deduction\" command, a first for the J.B. Harold series. Unlike previous games, proper use of this deduction is now required for progression, offering a more advanced mystery adventure.\n\nLooking back at its historical context, the game also featured an interesting experiment for its time. \"KISS OF MURDER\" required players to load image data from \"Manhattan Requiem\" in order to play. As a result, owning a copy of \"Manhattan Requiem\" was necessary. It is said that the developers assumed, \"Since this is a side story, only fans who own the previous game would buy it. So let\u2019s make it low-priced by loading data from the prior title!\"\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/319b5aafc401db1a13b2fa398ca0759526088c3c76bcaed7e8d820a6982e0c3d.jpg","id":"01001D90250F6000","intro":"The third entry in the detective J.B.

It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side.\n\nOn the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance\u2014as she speaks with the devil himself.\n\nIndika\u2019s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov.\n\nENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES\n\nThe subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika\u2019s journey and she\u2019ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey.\n\nOdd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren\u2019t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms. Their game is a great testament to that, as INDIKA constitutes an open challenge to the industry's established approach to creating video games.\n\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/53b541f480b37104ff90a8f2bb38c69fd0662f8cc1c6ed6e945756d612dd717b.jpg","id":"0100DE302439E000","intro":"Play a third-person, story-driven game set in alternative Russia at the turn of the XIX century where religious visions clash with harsh reality.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","pt","en","es","fr","de","ru","zh","zh"],"name":"INDIKA","nsuId":70010000100649,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"11 bit studios","rating":18,"ratingContent":["Bad Language","Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251117,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/200810a766b53f08f4365e53d14a050780623b19db780dff2255388688f11b87.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5dce45543a9b31beb28ed9af3d53cf808bf9e45fd7bc9c4ab52500f1f4d2feb7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b08cb383ad735052a1c9f7f8cfb8b53967b7a69086474b8337a4b5c62b12f4ac.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/df53d1426b18cd5ce832a6fb589d2443d44265337040f8dd374662a945836ee7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/90c883ca429607b8be02d3b8bf1f44eb2382f64c4f6d28c4f9dfcd3d43ca803d.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3556300bf3d8b0629bed9f88c7b34d2849753b2437758a893d60fceb2f51f50e.jpg"],"size":12154044416,"version":null},"70010000064552":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d42cac031f56e316160faeee8aa845bd7df62cdcf35a89d23fbe942564f94761.jpg","category":["RPG","Strategy"],"description":"Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island.\n\n \u2022 Story - A light horror narrative told through huge avatars with side quests aplenty.\n \u2022 Tactics - Rewind any action during the planning phase and create combos to dispatch your foes.\n \u2022 Schedule - Plan your school schedule to level your characters and build their skills.\n \u2022 Friendship - 15 characters with whom to build relationships.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a1bf1f2b6f2309924b35face6653547fbdfda04b032a4828ac892ce2145e2b72.jpg","id":"0100CD601AB4C000","intro":"Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","zh"],"name":"Demonschool","nsuId":70010000064552,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Ysbryd Games","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Moderate Violence","Sexual Innuendo"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251119,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6ca39a638d956b2775dbe81424ff8f86a73752fb094b1f971fcefe46e51ae4d1.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e3819de102b5a426c62525f06e23a88c1cc303078e201df72108f1d53a29445c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/4ac5945d4d41ef3034ebb0174fd527d0ca5394e5414e55a91e58bc869692f53f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0997a06676dd4cae5f60c3bd795073f9d2e70cf55f9b8afc4a5131dca9a762be.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/308db6919fd9c34c321d023703149d5dcf9732a5b4ad23371dae3a8ca4a98087.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/aad760ef0f09126b168b2d7b0a218d927bd7f765ea6d015bd2014945044c269f.jpg"],"size":2270167040,"version":null},"70010000095860":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a8b89b31ca188b24ea7890acb404e724a6e6b178799f93329fe969057742bc27.jpg","category":["Puzzle","Platformer"],"description":"After awakening to find herself trapped in a mysterious dream world, Lily is forced to face her past traumas and experiences.

1980s.\n\nLong ago, in the Tohoku region of Japan, people were tormented by malevolent spirits, Y\u014dkais.\nHowever, through people's unity and after a long battle, they managed to trap the Supreme Leader deep in the earth and built a shrine on top of it.\nTime passed...\nOne day, the Supreme Leader who was imprisoned underground resurfaces, putting the Tohoku region in danger once again. \nAs the master of the shrine, you must cleanse each area and free the Y\u014dkais captured by the Supreme Leader.\n\n\uff1cGameplay\uff1e\nDraw lines to enclose areas while avoiding collisions with enemies and boss attacks in each stage. \nThe area enclosed by the line will be unsealed. \nContinue unsealing areas to release the characters trapped in the background.\n\n<Clear Conditions>\nTo clear the stage, enclose the character's silhouette and meet the stage-specific quota (%). \nEven if your health reaches \"0\", you will still clear the stage if the quota is achieved.\nAfter clearing a stage, you will receive a lovely \"reward\" from the freed Y\u014dkais.\n\n<Stage Variations>\nThere are 50 different types. \nSo every time you play, the stage size may be different.\n\n<Game Over>\nThe game will end if time runs out or if you run out of health.\n\n\uff1cUnrivaled Barrier\uff1e\nThis barrier can block enemy attacks. \nIt can be activated as long as you hold down the

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\n\nNow 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!\n\nThe original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian and Spanish. This makes it highly recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers to the SaGa series.\n\nFeatures\n\u2022\tBrand new localization in French, German, Italian and Spanish (English also included)\n\u2022\tFull HD graphical update\n\u2022\tSchiele, Marina, Monica and Flammar can now be recruited\n\u2022\tEnhanced and more difficult bosses\n\u2022\tHigh speed mode\n\u2022\tMini Maps\n\u2022\tNew Game+ mode","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/83289b0804484fb39504971c1b0837e880545dfce9cfc4eb252e5bbe20f0fe12.jpg","id":"010074701FE72000","intro":"Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate.

Dress up your mascots and dunk basketballs, balloons or even anvils in crazy locations from all over the universe like space stations, dinosaur parks and haunted houses. It's dunk or be dunked (on). \n\nEASY TO PICK UP\nPlays like your favourite platformer with familiar and simple controls meaning anyone can take to the court and start dunking.\n\nMASTER YOUR BALL CONTROL\nAIM & THROW \u2013 Total 360\u00b0 analogue arm control allows you to AIM, THROW and slam DUNK the ball at the exact angle you want. \n\nBLOCK & DEFLECT \u2013 Defend your goal! Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark? We got it covered. Customise your characters with hundreds of different body parts and more than 2 and a half million procedural team and player names. Who knows, there might even be cameo appearances. Wouldn't that be cool?\n\nDUNK ACROSS THE UNIVERSE\nPlay across 8 unique arenas from all over the universe.
