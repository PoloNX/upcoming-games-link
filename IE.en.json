Now, 27 years later, history repeats itself with R-Type Delta: HD Boosted. With its tight level design, three selectable ships, powerful Delta Weapons, and the brilliant Force mechanic, this new edition proves that gaming classics of this caliber are truly timeless. If you played R-Type Delta back in the day, this is the perfect opportunity to return to its dark science fiction action. If you've never experienced this essential piece of gaming history before, now is the time. \n \nSHARPER THAN EVER  \nR-Type Delta: HD Boosted features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this PlayStation masterpiece until they\u2019re sharp enough to cut glass. You simply haven\u2019t experienced R-Type Delta until you've played it in high definition. This version of the game also comes equipped with a new Practice Mode for those of you who want to polish your skills until they are as sharp as the resolution itself! \n \nNEW MUSIC BY H\u00dcLSBECK, ISHIDA AND THE USP SOUND TEAM \nThe atmospheric music has always been a highlight of R-Type Delta. The HD Boosted version also includes brand-new, optional tracks composed by Masahiko Ishida (R-Type II, Image Fight), the USP sound team (who wrote the music for the original 1998 version), and \u2013 last but by no means least \u2013 Chris H\u00fclsbeck. H\u00fclsbeck is, of course, one of the true icons of video game music, having previously worked on R-Type for the C64 and Amiga. This new R-Type Delta: HD Boosted soundtrack is truly out of this world! \n \nENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING \nWhat has always made R-Type Delta so fantastic is its dark, eerie atmosphere. Shoot-'em-ups are not typically known for storytelling, but R-Type Delta: HD Boosted excels with its simple, minimalist environmental storytelling, characteristic of the late \u201990s. It\u2019s a narrative that is as fascinating as it is unsettling, as adrenaline-pumping as it is deeply disturbing. And all this without a single word being spoken. \n \nTHE MEANING OF DELTA \nThe name \u201cDelta\u201d carries several meanings. Firstly, the Greek letter delta resembles a triangle, which coincidentally has as many sides as there are playable ships in the game. It is also the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, and R-Type Delta is the fourth game in the R-Type series. Additionally, the delta triangle is the simplest type of polygon, which is fitting since R-Type Delta was the first game in the series to use three-dimensional polygon graphics instead of two-dimensional sprites. \n \nSTORY \nThe year is 2163, and the badly damaged R9 Arrowhead fighter has just returned to Earth after its mission to destroy the Bydo Empire. The vessel is rescued by the battle-cruiser Croque-Monsieur and transported to an orbital space station. One year later, astronomers in Central Asia observe mysterious objects falling from the sky, and moments later, control is lost over the orbiting annihilation platform Moritz-G. This high-tech machine, capable of destroying the entire planet, descends over a city and levels it to the ground. Although its planet-destroying weapons have not yet been activated, its advanced defense systems make Moritz-G virtually impossible to approach. A desperate military operation is launched, and the prototype ship R9aII Delta is deployed to resolve the situation. Thus begins the epic battle that is R-Type Delta!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c1828af76f2f0298adf36b2dde7cd74b0a86fce33b1ed79368897c85c21fb553.jpg","id":"0100B3B02459E000","intro":"The legendary shoot-'em-up returns; remastered, reloaded, and razor-sharp.","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en"],"name":"R-Type Delta: HD Boosted","nsuId":70010000101152,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Clear River Games","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20251120,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5d4c746216404a5635d8695bccc6fc5c69d8c3ad919c9ad0fcaf0c3f5685babc.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/b4a583f1753ef9b526f6f5baa0554c5e3a1b90f4c5b2bd06b1feb3712d81254a.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ccdb15adea2a5b5c4a500423e4b5950dadc09aef2b96536cb4be041248f734f3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/deb26bc6cce6e56945bdadba3425c1518816d61fe730b52d41310611f5d17862.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/88da92603059b770da7505e7f9c71d76a682c74ce7de55ff670a2f5574cd7a5c.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e69b00c53cdea9e1d5dc681411a26f3f4c909555509861fc2364aee979cea0e7.jpg"],"size":908066816,"version":null},"70010000106488":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e4f8a3458f9fbdc0ab79a10ef46230c70e10a9117f8864a4971d032e0cd2f704.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","Simulation","Other"],"description":"Run the cozy, rain-soaked kiosk and serve the meals to some very \u201cinteresting\u201d customers. \nKeep the orders coming, soak in the eerie atmosphere and try not to think too hard about what happened to the last guy who worked here (He's... gone.

1980s.\n\nLong ago, in the Tohoku region of Japan, people were tormented by malevolent spirits, Y\u014dkais.\nHowever, through people's unity and after a long battle, they managed to trap the Supreme Leader deep in the earth and built a shrine on top of it.\nTime passed...\nOne day, the Supreme Leader who was imprisoned underground resurfaces, putting the Tohoku region in danger once again. \nAs the master of the shrine, you must cleanse each area and free the Y\u014dkais captured by the Supreme Leader.\n\n\uff1cGameplay\uff1e\nDraw lines to enclose areas while avoiding collisions with enemies and boss attacks in each stage. \nThe area enclosed by the line will be unsealed. \nContinue unsealing areas to release the characters trapped in the background.\n\n<Clear Conditions>\nTo clear the stage, enclose the character's silhouette and meet the stage-specific quota (%). \nEven if your health reaches \"0\", you will still clear the stage if the quota is achieved.\nAfter clearing a stage, you will receive a lovely \"reward\" from the freed Y\u014dkais.\n\n<Stage Variations>\nThere are 50 different types. \nSo every time you play, the stage size may be different.\n\n<Game Over>\nThe game will end if time runs out or if you run out of health.\n\n\uff1cUnrivaled Barrier\uff1e\nThis barrier can block enemy attacks. \nIt can be activated as long as you hold down the button, but it gradually depletes.\nOnce the remaining amount reaches \"0,\" you will no longer be able to block attacks.\n\n\uff1cTranscendence Orbs\uff1e\nCollect three Transcendence Orbs on the

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\n\nNow 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!\n\nThe original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian and Spanish. This makes it highly recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers to the SaGa series.\n\nFeatures\n\u2022\tBrand new localization in French, German, Italian and Spanish (English also included)\n\u2022\tFull HD graphical update\n\u2022\tSchiele, Marina, Monica and Flammar can now be recruited\n\u2022\tEnhanced and more difficult bosses\n\u2022\tHigh speed mode\n\u2022\tMini Maps\n\u2022\tNew Game+ mode","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/83289b0804484fb39504971c1b0837e880545dfce9cfc4eb252e5bbe20f0fe12.jpg","id":"010074701FE72000","intro":"Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate.
