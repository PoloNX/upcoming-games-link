With a strict hand limit of just three cards, you must carefully manage your resources. Read the enemy\u2019s telegraphed attacks and choose your path: use your \"Jinma Cards\" to strike, or hold them in hand to bolster your defenses? Every successful battle grants you a choice of a new Jinma card to add to your current deck, opening up endless strategic deck building possibilities. Experience a battle system that is streamlined, fast-paced, and deceptively deep.\n\nA Gripping Story Where Myth and Reality Collide\nA multi-perspective saga of four \"Tsukuyomi\" agents, each walking a divergent path. Switch between characters to experience their conflicting convictions and personal battles. Only by reaching the summit will you uncover the colossal truth hidden within THE HASHIRA.\n\nForge a Unique Arsenal Through Every Decision\nYour decisions during exploration directly shape the properties of special \"Creation Cards\" that are earned and added to your deck over the course of your exploration. Even if you fall in battle, these cards are not lost to the void. Instead, you retain the chance to reclaim them in future runs. Through repeated cycles of death and rebirth, your deck expands and evolves, allowing you to craft a build that is uniquely yours.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/44fd5d146bc354b58353f740e6060256e2ea7c8bce08202d507bd153d292bca7.jpg","id":"0100D21024DF6000","intro":"Ancient myths awaken in a modern-day Babel.
