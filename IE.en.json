The player takes on the role of Prince Lancelot, who rises to reclaim Camelot Castle.\n\nThe game uses a strategy map to move troops, and when engaging enemy forces on the map, it switches to a real-time battle system where soldiers fight in real-time. Although it may initially seem like an RTS, each character has a defined personality, with injured characters choosing to leave the battlefield to rest, and archers trying to maintain distance from the enemy. Some units are stubborn and refuse to retreat, adding a layer of individuality to the battlefield. This personality system leads to diverse and dynamic combat scenarios. Additionally, characters can level up and become stronger through repeated battles, adding an element of character progression.\n\nThe game also features a narrative aspect, with scenarios where traveling across various battlefields and regions can increase allies and obtain new equipment. Occasionally, boss battles occur, offering dramatic and engaging adventures. This game successfully combines the best elements of simulation and RPG systems.\n\nAs the first title in the Gochakara series, it continues to be supported by retro game fans. It's a highly recommended title for players who enjoy both simulation and narrative-driven RPG elements.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c7f59b0778b650d07323ef1bf2b036c5c91a28e3c726a4dedea826316613772c.jpg","id":"0100B8C02057C000","intro":"A masterpiece that brilliantly merges simulation and RPG genres with a medieval backdrop.

Embark on an exciting adventure fit for both new players and long-time fans, highlighting classic and new SaGa franchise features, full Japanese and English voiceovers, rearranged compositions, and much more! \n\nSTORY \nIn an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most...\nTrue to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them.\n\nTake on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! \n\nKEY FEATURES \n\u25a0 Characters & Imperial Succession \nJoin forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist.\nThe knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters.\n\n\u25a0Free-Form Scenario \nThe game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first\u2014from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey.\n\n\u25a0Combat \nThe strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like \"Glimmers,\" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and \"Formations,\" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new \"United Attack\" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle!\n \n\u25a0Graphics \nThe original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts.\n \n\u25a0Difficulty Settings \nSelect from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). \nCasual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version.\n\n\u25a0Music & Voices \nKenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen.\nFurthermore, all event scenes now feature full Japanese and English voice acting.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/85cd020706d10c0672fc1e3a7316774e44a78948514819ed95ef7ddbd0d6cc91.jpg","id":"010045301B86C000","intro":"Save Your Empire.

Help Morkull escape from the Ragast so he can rule the world and carry out his evil plans.\nYou know, typical clich\u00e9 villain stuff...\n\n\nArt and Animation\n\nMorkull Ragast's Rage is completely hand-drawn and animated frame-by-frame. Inspired and influenced by traditional animated films and other 2D video games, the old-school style gives life and fluidity of movement to the whole cast of characters.\n\nBreak the Fourth Wall\n\nWhat makes this game special is Morkull himself, his personality, and his ability to break the fourth wall to talk with the players like he was there in the room.\n\nMorkull possesses charisma and charm, and never fails to create a light-hearted atmosphere with his endless humor, bad jokes and pop culture references.\n\nCombat System\n\nYou'll have all the power of the God of Death and Darkness at your fingertips, of course, along with an ample selection of combos and abilities that will open up even the most remote corners of the Ragast.\n\nBecome Part of the Ragast and Join Our Community\n\nOnce you enter the Ragast, you'll never leave \u2013 unless you can get through Morkull\u2026 So why not join his ranks and support his Machiavellian cause with the rest of his champions as part of our Morkull Ragast's Rage community.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/baa3ee2b7e45527e2649781483b154b7d30a1d3fe1d540d7359f3c9d98091140.jpg","id":"01002B801D096000","intro":"Help Morkull escape this cursed Metroidvania video game!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en","es"],"name":"Morkull Ragast's Rage","nsuId":70010000072755,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Selecta Play","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Mild Swearing"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250115,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76cd1fa437fb2115696b3207273361a7c8d8dfb20af0e66e74bf3415091d037f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/a0a9120d19b4e0c3ac18762b413682a4d7def6dd6e9103c8754b0a521a1b8976.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/7df3ae4ebd15d4b2f831a0016dbe37087048e1a4d281ba20b90337ac70f48654.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e0923429fcd1bb55cdb20801644122e8c1689b27001fa395432421a8bb1cd46e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/829f3c13f8b2a8c32543d3d4ff149d328bb69966c2fce8bcfd3fc3e698ec0265.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5fe9643076cd57af6d541fe866985d10cf096e971a4eca45c2caf6bfcbb402bb.jpg"],"size":405798912,"version":null},"70010000084603":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6b56c7e52d3ae0461302df8daf1cc09496b9e07502e8636b1cff472cc0cfb811.jpg","category":["Platformer"],"description":"Help Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong recover their precious banana hoard from the villainous Tiki Tak Tribe in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD!

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised. Rich and evocative descriptions of the ship, including the constant rumble of the engine room, the bustle of the bridge, the silence of space pair with an extensive range of scenes that have been meticulously designed and animated in detail to deliver an immersive experience. Inspired by the best that anime has to offer the ship even features \"Armoured Frames\", mechanised, human shaped, weapons of war.\n\nThe Characters \u2013 Get on board with the crew of the Gun-Dog !\n\nAll stories are about people and the cast of \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d bring the story to life, so much so that their charm and charisma convinced the team at Astrolabe Games to board the Gun-Dog and sign up to be the publisher. From the elegant yet distant Captain Bartermews, to the bubbly Lieutenant Commander Cassandra Quinn, to the assertive and domineering Chief Mackenzie Cathays, \u201cThe Gun-Dog\u201d features an extensive cast of characters for you to meet. Each crew member has a distinct personality, role and history. Get to know them and their quirks and decide whether to work with or against them to unravel the mystery that lies at the story\u2019s heart.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/d2674e1bb3e7ef9924994246abc538515852789e74b6e0f67a4c7d469a314c08.jpg","id":"010004201D1E6000","intro":"War is over.
