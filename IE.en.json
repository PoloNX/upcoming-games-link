When you guide the cats with the designated patterns into the holes in the correct order, a combo occurs. Successful combos extend the time limit. Once the game starts, carefully observe the patterns of the cats and plan your route to the dens. Sometimes, you have to solve the mysteries placed on the stage for the dens to appear. Users who participated in the crowdfunding can see their own cats' photos and names featured as card items in the game. Lead the special cats that appear on the stage to the dens in large numbers to complete your card collection.",

    "description": "Train Traffic Manager isn't your grandpa's model railway set. Think fast, plan faster, and keep those trains from turning into flaming metal confetti. In this strategy-puzzle game, you're in charge of everything from switches and signals to drawbridges and, oh yeah, preventing cataclysmic train disasters.\n\nTake on over 80 levels across diverse environments that range from sunny desertscapes to mysterious midnight scenes. It's more fun than a cactus in your caboose!\n\nEach environment has its own unique challenges. Deserts have meteor showers (because of course they do), forests have fallen trees (what's a forest without a little lumber?), winters bring the freeze to your switches, and at midnight, well, you'll just have to see.\n\nAnd if the chaos of normal mode gets too much, take a breather in endless mode. No objectives, just you, the tracks, and an infinite number of trains. It's the zen garden of train management!\n\nReady to dive into the madness? Take control of the tracks and show that chaos who's boss in Train Traffic Manager.\n\nAnd remember: don't fall asleep at your post!\n\nThis bundle includes base game and DLC #1 (Subterranean Switch-Up)  with:\n\n- 10 brand new underground maps that challenge you to navigate the dimly lit and intricate tunnels.\n\n",

Here he finds giant walnuts galore, but getting them home won\u2019t be easy! Solve puzzles and challenges across a variety of unique levels, gather a horde of giant walnuts, and help Chico get back to his forest!\n\nWith unique dual-mode gameplay, you\u2019ll have to really use your nut to crack these worlds. Alone, Chico can jump over obstacles and push wall switches. If he has a walnut, he can roll it over spikes, bounce it off of walls and bumpers, and more. Find a way to get the walnut through to the end of the level with you! Each world introduces unique new mechanics that will test your brain and your skills.\n\nChico and the Magic Orchards is made to evoke 8-bit handheld games. Catchy chiptune music, simple controls, and pixel-grid filters let you feel like you're playing a \"lost classic\"! Play the game in fixed 4-color mode, automatic palette mode with a special 4-color palette for each area, or the new Full Color mode!\n\nEven after the end credits roll, that's not the end of Chico's adventure! Continue your game after beating it to start playing the new post-game campaign A Hive Divided! Rescue trapped bees across two new giant levels, and defeat the Queen Bee. Power up your walnut with fire, water, and honey for a whole new spin on solving puzzles and exploring areas!",

    "description": "ARK: Genesis Part 2 completes the eons-spanning story of ARK: Survival Evolved! Everything that your tribe has built, tamed, and fought for has led to this final challenge. With your faithful artificial companion HLN-A by your side, you\u2019ve emerged from the Genesis simulation to find yourself aboard a gigantic starship being overtaken by a familiar threat from the distant past.\n\nIn Genesis Part 2, you\u2019ll explore a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills. Wielding an array of powerful new tames, items, weapons, and structures, you\u2019ll journey from idyllic fields through twilit phantasmagoric realms, all the way into a hellish heart of darkness. Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you\u2019ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time!\n\nNEW STORY-ORIENTED MISSIONS\nA holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of engaging new story-oriented missions at varying difficulty levels, as you build strength to confront Rockwell in a final battle for the ages. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover Explorer Notes and environmental cues along the way to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga.\n\nEXPANSIVE WORLDS TO CONQUER\nIn ARK: Genesis 2, you\u2019ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor. Your skills, your tames, your weapons and your builds -- everything that you\u2019ve accomplished is put to the test here, as the future of humanity hangs in the balance!",

Your goal is to find your way out of the laboratory and gain your freedom by overcoming various obstacles and collecting diamonds. The game features a mix of platforming and puzzle-solving elements, with plenty of obstacles to avoid along the way.\n\nThe environment is filled with challenges, including cannons, spikes, jump pads, and windmills. Players must be very careful and think twice before making a move, as one wrong step can send them back to the beginning of the level. The game also features a variety of logical puzzles that will challenge players' problem-solving skills and test their agility.\n\nCollecting diamonds is key to unlocking the next level and progressing through the game. Players have the opportunity to become skilled navigators by mastering the platforming elements and using their quick reflexes to overcome obstacles. To jump in the game, players need to hold down the jump button to charge up their jump, and then release it to jump. This adds an extra layer of control and precision to the platforming elements.\n\nGeoJelly is a game that requires skill, patience, and strategy, making it a thrilling experience for players of all skill levels.\n",

He and his sons left for war 150 years ago against the TRADDESS and ZOOGT empires, lightyears away from SHINORUBI.\n\nThe kingdom was entrusted to five generals close to the royal family, under the command of the king's only daughter: NEMEZIYA BA\u00c4A.\n\nNight falls on KADDIN, the capital...

It's every pirate for themselves in a back-stabbing, treasure-grabbing struggle, and only one may live...\n\nBullion: The Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle is a local multiplayer brawler for up to four players, featuring a cast of backstabbing bovine buccaneers and a unique blend of PvP and co-op gameplay.\n\nStranded on the Islands of Ser-Lloyn, the heathen gods have declared that only the one bringing the greatest offering of treasure shall live - so each pirate must grab as much loot as they can! Even death will not deny the gods their game; fallen pirates become ghosts and can return to life at their gravestones. However... should the entire crew fall at the same time then the game ends with no winner - so players must balance working together in order to keep at least one crewmember alive with doing whatever it takes in order to have the most treasure at the end of the battle! Unlock the secrets, voyage across the islands and battle titanic champions in an attempt to defy the gods and attempt to survive the Curse of the Cut-Throat Cattle!",

Adventure into the beautiful and treacherous lands of Kenzera as Zau, a young shaman who bargains with the God of death to bring his Baba back from darkness. With your cosmic powers and untried courage, you advance into unknown mythological lands. Once bursting with life, Kenzera is now rife with lost ancestral spirits. As Zau advances toward his goal, three mighty beings lie in wait, fearsome in their strength yet somehow strangely familiar.
