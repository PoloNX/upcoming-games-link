Changes from the original version\nBelow are the main changes from the original version. \n\n1: Balance adjustments that make it easier to play \nThe player\u2019s armaments have been buffed across the board.\nTo accommodate this change, enemy attacks and other variables have been adjusted. \nIn addition, the difficulty level of the existing \"NORMAL,\" \"HARD,\" and \"EXPERT\" modes were lowered. \nAs a result, the game has been adjusted to be more forgiving and easier to play than the original version!\n\n2: Difficulty level \"HELL\" added\nThe much harder \"HELL\" mode has been added, it is considerably more difficult than the previous highest difficulty \"EXPERT\". \nConsider it a challenge from G.rev to those who have mastered Strania!\n\n3: Addition of an arranged soundtrack\nThe game can be played with a soundtrack arranged by Keishi Yonao himself, who was in charge of the music in the original version!\n\n4: The true ending is now obtainable on the \"NORMAL\" difficulty level\nIn the original version, you could not get the true ending by playing on the \u201cNORMAL\u201d difficulty. But in \u201cEX\u201d, you can reach the true ending even on the \u201cNORMAL\u201d difficulty.\n\n5: DLC \"SIDE VOWER\" from the original version included\nThe additional story \"SIDE VOWER\", which was originally sold separately as DLC, will now be included for free with the Nintendo Switch\u2122 version! \nExperience \"Strania\" once again from the perspective of Bower's army, the enemy of the Strania army!","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/0faaccb982679be1841cb9e70a0a3d715855de1221c38e97db70999d29fc5fa0.jpg","id":"010080F012516000","intro":"The excitement of a true \"ARCADE GAME\" can now be experienced once again!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en","es","fr","de","it"],"name":"Strania -The Stella Machina- EX","nsuId":70010000075848,"numberOfPlayers":2,"publisher":"G.rev","rating":7,"ratingContent":["Mild Violence"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250123,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/237d70b6a7ebd960e3c944c42eb4eb2709e5e21392e103d3dc4834cdfb526db5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/57048ff7bc939b08df3afb02b86973622668debe2880b90b9108dfb90e9ea297.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/186be0d34eaaa0220d374ee41fdcf90ad52b4006a11cc9995dca39067facd48e.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6c09195aa48e18a261892199cd4a81f5ed83662a27a10a74597cee08e84ea8d3.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/bab2ccf45e6ae48db03b19eb4050aefa725071b5ee2e6efb0f55b18024a408c7.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/2ab4d87d5c516a683c1c05ae98dbed72126710a1637f4de71cb732c504f90960.jpg"],"size":905969664,"version":null},"70010000076693":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5da1aedace486d9a7c94310dd4072b4f9635d6f192d745030a704c70301810d3.jpg","category":["Action","Adventure","Other"],"description":"TALES GONE DARK \nRavenswatch is a top-down roguelike action game in which you play as heroes of tales and legends that must slay hordes of nightmarish creatures in nerve-racking fights.

Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners - plagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair - pool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape.\n\nEscape the Monastery\nEscaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more. \n\nExplore your surroundings and combine the characters\u2019 abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you\u2019re caught being somewhere you shouldn\u2019t be, the guards will not be kind.\n\nManage the Madness\nTo effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters' mental health.\n\nEach playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character\u2019s sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played.\n\nDiscover the Secrets Within\nChoose from two full-fledged campaigns to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises. \n\nTime is continuous in The Stone of Madness. Actions have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions.\n \nSneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters\u2019 sanity.\n \nNighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about.

Get ready for a classic hardcore adventure.","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3f09d62c8429ef3fa8db7362947ccbf4255149f7c8b2980fcbd3eadbb1bc45ae.jpg","id":"010090E0205D2000","intro":"Wizardry: The Five Ordeals has arrived!","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["ja","en"],"name":"Wizardry: The Five Ordeals","nsuId":70010000086434,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"Game*Spark Publishing","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Mild Swearing"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250129,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5f31709c794b52c523f8f5ca473bcc62a7e2e740cae0f8fad5374ad9da431feb.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/e13a2c75bb7ce9e5e548afe774d769faf18461ff2e8aae1a30852c033463c926.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adba61314d8e3ea2f8636bf0247637e3d394222033182795f0d87548b6485efe.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/6bbdf44ec87880408ebcf96aee0fb41a3d5a9001be5219d280968996275ae2ef.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/3e8b918d6fc943982859cadb836c9890cef3fa1dd2714b1a0b3039ae5363d22f.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/381f5cf4667b556bc6db550ee3ccf2a5d7c83dd66aa571373a7d08108acc029a.jpg"],"size":1180696576,"version":null},"70010000089670":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/c2e682af3ca7b8938484578736541e6098a002de8a4493d9f1e4b8791f1679c9.jpg","category":["Action","Platformer","Arcade"],"description":"Simple but addictive gameplay.

A witch who lost her powers when young and now living a quiet life, Emma is led by the memento her father left her and finds herself swept away with the arrival of a travelling amusement park in town.\n\nFilled with magic and dreams but holding a dark secret, Emma feels an immediate connection to the wondrous La Foire du R\u00eave. She discovers that hidden underneath the lustrous fairy-like charm of the park, its employees are trapped, bound to the amusement park and only the magic within Emma can free them. But it has been years since Emma has been able to access her magic, and she must dig deep within herself, navigating painful repressed memories, in order to recover it.\n\nWorking at the R\u00eave as she unravels the tangled threads of her forgotten past, Emma forges bonds with the employees of the amusement park. A cast of wonderful characters; the dazzling director Hugo, the stoic accountant Serge, the Tsundere Performer Crier, the kind-hearted rabbit Lyon, the Reclusive Mechanic Luciole, and Emma\u2019s special childhood friend, Arnaud. Each character with their own crosses to bear, stories of tragedy and longing woven together with desperation, Emma builds deepening bonds of friendship, and maybe more, as she works to unlock her magic and their freedom.\n\nWith its gorgeously subdued artwork, radiating warmth and romance, Genso Man\u00e8ge is a dream-like otome fantasy with an outstanding visual power that conjures an unforgettably bittersweet tale.\n","developer":null,"frontBoxArt":null,"iconUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/12b4224f6576142da1c272f979adb092ca53d9f4c57d4da00b9a7246ea51fe31.jpg","id":"0100EBB01C4BE000","intro":"A magical mystery brimming with romance","isDemo":false,"key":null,"languages":["en"],"name":"Genso Man\u00e8ge","nsuId":70010000070244,"numberOfPlayers":1,"publisher":"PQube","rating":12,"ratingContent":["Bad Language","Sex"],"region":null,"releaseDate":20250131,"rightsId":null,"screenshots":["https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/5e137bb3e0109b9f4389b813850607f0ccbeafc06e3b9a7ee579c8c5ee9cd2a5.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/adb327f721455c5d3fce4d018711fb30c5e2f8f8356f508c46029f0246061808.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/24c44787041f6c84c973f5fa63a4a73f1f435d504b05cad1c3f53720d6f85d24.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/ef8965040305310e0dcc5d05801e68421ada66db4b887bc5e590ac4b0ed0b9cd.jpg","https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/76ed6f20add04c08913c33398fffef51ac2551de0159fc8d976b81c3ea3afc9e.jpg"],"size":3274702848,"version":null},"70010000082747":{"bannerUrl":"https://img-eshop.cdn.nintendo.net/i/31090b492494ae8ebd2e475b550abd4b486f3f54530f7a336ce6de440c8f5ef5.jpg","category":["Adventure","RPG"],"description":"The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022\u2019s most acclaimed RPGs!\n\nYou are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body. You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper\u2019s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.\n\nPUSH YOUR LUCK\nEach character class now has a unique \u201cPush\u201d ability that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success.\n\nNAVIGATE THE BELT\nChart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Starward Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.\n\nDO THE JOB, GET PAID\nContracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FUTURE\nPlayer choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices.
