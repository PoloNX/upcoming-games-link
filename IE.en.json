I cried because I realized how painful it would be for the ones who love me.\"\n\nLoving Life is a short, non-fictional auto-biographical visual novel created in 2012 by Zhenghua Yang (Z), the founder of Serenity Forge, as a reflection on a near-fatal incident that changed his life. \n\n- Story -\n\nAt age 18, Z was a typical college student: driven by academic performance, struggling with family pressure, and wrestling with the viewpoints of his peers. However, as his first semester of college came to a close, his ordinary life would dissolve... with a 14 hour nosebleed and mere hours left to live.\n\nLoving Life is Z's honest reflection of this episode of his life, weaving between prose, dialogue, and dream, as he traverses the deadly space between his present life, his past, and whatever that may come next. \n\n- Features -\n\nLoving Life was the first product released under the Serenity Forge label, and it marks an origin for the studio's commitment to emotional honesty, artistic experimentation, and narrative exploration. To commemorate Serenity Forge's 10th anniversary, we remastered and released on Steam with a raft of quality of life enhancements. Now, fans of the studio, new and old, can see where it all began.\n\n- A Personal Reflection: As an auto-biographical VN, Loving Life tells its story with equal parts poetic recollection and honest conclusions. Read Z's memories, follow his thoughts, and live through his dreams as he navigates this profound episode in his life.\n- Beautiful Visions: All of the game's art is hand-painted, from portraits of Z's friends to the surreal dreamscapes he traversed while in recovery. \n- The Origin Story of Serenity Forge: Experience a story that reveals the cultural foundation of Serenity Forge, and that itself is an example of the studio's experimentation with games as vessels for meaning and emotional impact.\n- Remastered for Modern Platforms: Play with modern conveniences such as font accessibility controls, audio controls, text speed adjustments, and select remastered assets, with corrections to visuals and rendering on modern monitors.

Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event.\n\nFrom the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely.\n\nYou must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates.\n\nHowever, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone?\n\nUltimately, everything is about choices and consequences.\n\nFeatures\n\nChoose how you want to follow the game\u2019s story.\n\nThe complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. \n\nYou can concentrate on just one particular character\u2019s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. \n\nYou can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline \u2013 essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause.\n\nOr you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses. \n\nWatch and change things as many times as you like.\n\nCan\u2019t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you\u2019re not sure you like the consequences? That\u2019s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like.\n\nChange the past to affect the future.\n\nSetting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events.

Everything that your tribe has built, tamed, and fought for has led to this final challenge. With your faithful artificial companion HLN-A by your side, you\u2019ve emerged from the Genesis simulation to find yourself aboard a gigantic starship being overtaken by a familiar threat from the distant past.\n\nIn Genesis Part 2, you\u2019ll explore a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills. Wielding an array of powerful new tames, items, weapons, and structures, you\u2019ll journey from idyllic fields through twilit phantasmagoric realms, all the way into a hellish heart of darkness. Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you\u2019ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time!\n\nNEW STORY-ORIENTED MISSIONS\nA holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of engaging new story-oriented missions at varying difficulty levels, as you build strength to confront Rockwell in a final battle for the ages. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover Explorer Notes and environmental cues along the way to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga.\n\nEXPANSIVE WORLDS TO CONQUER\nIn ARK: Genesis 2, you\u2019ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor.

Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War. Our protagonist, scarred from the loss of his crewmates in the war, is re-assigned to the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog as it\u2019s dispatched with orders to investigate mysterious\u00a0signals coming from the edge of Jovian Space.  \nUnknown to the Gun-Dog\u2019s crew, a new danger looms deep in the ocean of stars, threatening not just the Gun-Dog but all her crew.\n\nTake on the role of the Gun-Dog's security officer as you attempt to save the ship from an unknown assailant whilst navigating the paranoia, conspiracies and vendettas that break out amongst the crew. As camaraderie falls apart can you overcome the challenges that await?\n\nThe Game - A love letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi\n\nStories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a visual novel adventure in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles. Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an \"era-accurate\" game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.\n\nThe Story \u2013 A new threat emerges from the void.\n\nHumans have long since freed themslves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war. \nIt\u2019s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar. Four years have passed since the end of the Solar War and an uneasy peace persists throughout the solar system. The Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog is sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate mysterious signals coming from the edge of Jovian space. What starts as a routine assignment quickly escalates into a battle for survival as an unknown threat terrorises the crew.\n\nThe Gameplay \u2013 Investigate. Interact. Analyse. Advance.\n\nUtilising traditional point-and-click adventure mechanics, during your time on the Gun-Dog, you can navigate various locations on the ship, examine the details of the richly realised backgrounds or talk with the different crew members on board. You will need to listen  closely to the characters' words to reveal important clues or duplicitous intentions and keep your eyes peeled for key items and interactive elements in the backgrounds that you can use to advance the story.\n\nThe Place - Adventure in a entirely explorable ship!\n\nThe main stage of the first instalment in the \"Stories from Sol\" series, as the Jovian patrol ship Gun-Dog heads into deep space it serves as the setting for the game\u2019s story. It has been exhaustively realised.
