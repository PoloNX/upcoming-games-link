The game is not about defeating enemies or overcoming dangerous obstacles, but rather about immersing yourself in a peaceful and tranquil environment. It is designed to relax your mind and soul, providing a soothing escape from the stresses of everyday life.\nWith no threats or enemies to worry about, you can fully focus on enjoying the beauty of the world around you and the sensation of flying freely. The game aims to give you a sense of liberation and lightness, offering the perfect retreat to unwind after a busy day and leave behind the rush of the outside world.\nOne of the unique features of this game is that you can select the level that best suits your desire to relax. The levels are designed to be completed quickly, so you can enjoy a short break if you're looking for a brief moment of peace. However, if you have more time and wish to explore, you can take a slower pace and dive deeper into the environment. This flexibility allows you to choose the experience that fits your needs, whether it's a short moment of calm or a longer, more immersive journey.\nThe game showcases a beautiful collection of some of the most stunning landscapes from the Aery franchise. These carefully crafted sceneries offer a visual oasis of tranquillity, ranging from majestic mountains and vast forests to peaceful lakes and endless skies. Each scene is designed not only to delight the eyes but also to create an atmosphere of calm that invites you to relax.\nWe hope you enjoy the beautiful landscapes and that they help you unwind and find peace.

Extend your whole body for a stretchy block or deflection to keep your opponents from scoring. Or, become a platform to help your teammates reach that hoop.\n\nFEINT & SHIELD \u2013 Fool your opponent with a fake throw or shield the ball by holding it out of your opponent's reach.\n\nSOLO, CO-OP AND PVP MODES\nPlay solo or co-op with a friend in Quick Match, or against increasingly harder opponents in Galaxy Tour, Challenge or Cup modes. Or take on a friend, or up to 16 friends, in local multiplayer across the Quick Match, Mutator Madness and Tournament modes.\n\nCUSTOMISE YOUR DUNKER\nWant to play as a purple-robo-vampire-shark?
